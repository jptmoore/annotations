"and of all the Customary Oblations, which were, as we find, estimated communibus annis: of these the gross amount was to be returned. From this amount, however, they were allowed to make certain deductions before the value was ascertained, which was to be taken as the actual value of the Benefice or Dignity on which the First Fruits and Tenths were to be levied. These deductions consisted of (1.) the Rents resolute to the Chief Lords, and all other annual and perpetual rents and charges : (2.) the Alms which were due to the Poor, according to any foundation or ordinance : (8.) Fees to Stewards, Receivers, Bailiffs, and Auditors : and (4.) Synodals and Procurations, with which most Abbies and Benefices were charged. But the Instructions go in this point beyond the Act; and it being foreseen that claims might be set up for remuneration for Spiritual Services, the Commissioners are strictly enjoined to make no allowance for these ; and, with a less appearance of equity, to suffer no estimate of Repairs of Edifices to be taken into account when settling the clear annual income to be derived from them. â€˜ '"
