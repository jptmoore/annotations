"in the accounts of the Benefices, we have in the unimpropriate parishes an account of the value of the manse, glebe, and tythe (the value of each particular tythe being often set forth), with the oblations : and in the impro- priate, the sources of the Vicarâ€™s income ; while the other portions of the profits are accounted for by the Religious Houses to which the be- nefice was appropriated. From both these is the allowed reduction, which in the case of the Benefices is seldom more than the Syno- dals to the Archbishop and the Procurations to the Archdeacon. The Chantries and the Free Chapels have their less complex endow- ments plainly set forth."
