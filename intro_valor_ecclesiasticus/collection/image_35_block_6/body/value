"An Appendix is annexed to each Volume, consisting of Returns made in 1810, by the Prelates, of places in their respective Dioceses where there exists any Peculiar Jurisdiction : and it must be added that the integrity of the original Record has been so far violated in this publication as to introduce the new diocesal division of the country which was made in the Thirty-fourth of Henry VIIL, eight years after the date of this Survey."
