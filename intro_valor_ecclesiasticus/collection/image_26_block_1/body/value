"These payments are, however, no longer made to the Crown. Queen Anne, as an act of Royal Bounty to the Church, in the second year of her reign, gave up this source of re- venue ; not, indeed, giving it back to the hands which had to render it, but to Trustees, who were empowered to administer it for the benefit of the poorer Clergy. This gift of the Queen was confirmed by Act of Parliament 2 & 3 Anne, cap. 11."
