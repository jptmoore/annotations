"The execution of a work of this magnitude required, we may suppose, in some instances, more time than the terms of the Commission allowed. Yet in general it appears to have been executed between January and June in 1585. The returns however for the County of Lincoln are dated on the 3d of September in that year, and for the County of Bucks on the 26th of September."
