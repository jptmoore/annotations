"Without concern he hears, but hears from far, Of tumults, and descents, and distant war : Nor with a superstitious fear is aw'd, For what befalls at home, or what abroad. Nor envies he the rich their heapy store, Nor his own peace disturbs with pity for the poor. He feeds on fruits, which, of their own accord, The willing ground and laden trees afford, From his lov'd home no lucre him can draw; The senate's mad decrees he never saw ; Nor heard, at bawling bars, corrupted law. Some to the seas, and some to camps, resort, And some with impudence invade the court: In foreign countries, others seek renown ; With wars and taxes, others waste their own, And houses burn, and household gods deface, To drink in bowls which glittering gems enchase, To loll on couches, rich with citron steds, And lay their guilty limbs in Tyrian beds. This wretch in earth intombs his golden ore, Hovering and brooding on his bury’d store. Some patriot fools to popular praise aspire Of public speeches, which worse fools admire, While, from both benches, with redoubled sounds, The’ applause of lords and commoners abounds. Some, through ambition, or throngh thirst of gold, Have slain their brothers, or their country sold, And, leaving their sweet homes, in exile ran ‘To lands that lie beneath another sun."
