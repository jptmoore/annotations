"If herds or fleecy flocks be more thy care, Or goats that graze the field, and burn it bare, Then seek Tarentumâ€™s lawns, and furthest coast, Or such a field as hapless Mantua lost, Where silver swans sail down the watery road, And graze the floating herbage of the flood. There crystal streams perpetual tenor keep, Nor food nor springs are wanting to thy sheep :"
