"Achilles is proposed to imitation, not his pride and disobedience to his general, nor his brutal cruelty to his dead enemy, nor the selling his body to his father. We abhor these actions while we read them ; and what we abhor, we never imitate. The poet only shows them, like rocks or quicksands, to be shunned."
