"For, what the day devours, the nightly dew Shall to the morn in pearly drops renew. Fat crumbling earth is fitter for the plough, Patrid and loose ahove, and black below ; For ploughing is an imitative toil, Resembling nature in an easy soil. No land for seed like this; no fields afford So large an income to the village lord : No toiling teams from harvest-labour come = So late at night, so heavy-laden home. The like of forest land is understood, From whence the surlyploughman grubs the wood, Which had for length of ages idle stood. Then birds forsake the ruins of their seat, And,flying fromtheirnests, their callow young forget. The coarse lean gravel, on the mountain-sides, Scarce dewy beverage for the bees provides ; Nor chalk nor crumbling stones, the food of snakes, \"That work in hollow earth their winding tracks. The soil exhaling clouds of subtile dews, Imbibing moisture which with ease she spews, Which rusts not iron, and whose mould is clean, Well clothed with cheerful grass, and ever green, Is good for olives, and aspiring vines, Embracing husband-elms in amorous twines ; Is fit for feeding cattle, fit to sow, And equal to the pastare and the plough. Such is the soil of fat Campanian fields; [yields ; Such large increase the land that joins Vesuvius And such a country could Acerra boast, Till Clanius overflow'd the unhappy coast."
