"Here, we see, the poet considered all the effects of this union between trees of different kinds, and took notice of that effect which had the most sur- prise, and by consequence the most delight in it, to express the capacity that was in them of being thus united. This way of writing is every where much in nse among the poets, and is particularly practised by Virgil, who loves to suggest a truth indirectly, and, without giving us a full and open view of it, to let us see just so much as will natu- rally lead the imagination into all the parts that lie concealed. This is wonderfully diverting to the understanding, thus to receive a precept, that enters as it were through a by-way, and to appre- hend an idea that draws a whole train after it. For here the mind, which is always delighted with its own discoveries, only takes the hint from the poet, and seems to work out the rest by the strength of her own faculties."
