"He spoils the saffron flowers ; he sips the blzes Of violets, wilding blooms, and willow dews. Their toil is common ; common is their sleep ; They shake their wings when morn begins to peep ; Rush through the city-gates without deiay ; Nor ends their work, but with decliniug day. Then, having spent the last remains of light, They give their bodies due repose at night, ‘When hollow murmurs of their evening bells Dismiss thesleepy swains,and toll them to their cells, When once in beds their weary limbs they steep, No buazzing sounds disturb their golden sleep. T'is sacred silence all. Nor dare they stray, ‘When rain is promis'd, or a stormy day ; But near the city-walls their watering take, Nor forage far, but short excursions make. And as, when empty barks on billows float, With sandy ballast sailors trim the boat ; So bees bear gravel-stones, whose poising weight Steers through the whistling winds theirsteady flight. But (what's more strange) their modest appetites, Averse from Venus, {ly the nuptial rites. No lust enervates their heroic mind, Norv wastes their strength on wanton woman-kind : But in their mouths reside thieir genial powers : They gather childrea from the leaves and flowers. \"Thus make they kings to fill the regal seat, And thus their little citizens create, % And waxen cities build, the palaces of state. And oft on rocks their tender wings they tear, And sink bereath the burdens which they bear: Such rage of honey in their bosom beats ; And such a zeal they have for flowery sweets. VOL. I. N"
