"necessity that the time of a stage-action should so strictly be confined to twenty-four hours, as never to exceed them; for which Aristotle contends, and the Grecian stage has practised. Some longer space, on some occasions, I think, may be allowed;; especially for the English theatre, which requires more variety of incidents, than the French. Cor- neille himself, after long practice, was inclined to think that the time allotted by the ancients was too short to raise and finish a great action: and better a mechanic rule were stretched or broken, than a great beauty were omitted. To raise, and afterwards tocalm, the passions—to purge the soul from pride, by the examples of human miseries which befall the greatest—in few words, to expel arrogance, and introduce compassion, are the great effects of tragedy; great I must confess, if they were altogether as true as they are pompous. But are habits to beintroduced at three hours’ warning ¢ are radical diseases so suddenly removed? A moun- tebank may promise such a cure ; buta skilful phy- sician will not undertake it. An epic poem is not so much in haste: it works leisurely ; the changes which it makes are slow; but the cure is likely to be more perfect. The effects of tragedy, as I said, are too violent to be lasting. If it be an- swered, that for this reason, tragedies are often to be seen, and the dose to be repeated; this is tacitly to confess that there is more virtue in one heroic poem, than in many tragedies. A man is hambled one day ; and his pride returns the next."
