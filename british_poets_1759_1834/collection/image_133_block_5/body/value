"Now sing, my Muse, the growth of generous vines, The shady groves, the woodland progeny, And the slow product of Minerva’s tree. Great father Bacchus! to my song repair ; For clustering grapes are thy peculiar care: For thee, large bunches load the bending vine ; And the last blessings of the year are thine, To thee his joys the jolly Autumn owes, When the fermenting juice the vat o’erflows."
