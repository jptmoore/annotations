"Franks and other Germans (having neither corn nox wine of their ownâ€™ growth), when they passed the Rhine,and possessed themselves of countries better cultivated, left the tillage of the land to the old pro- prietors; and afterwards continued to hazard their lives as freely for their diversion, as they had done before for theirnecessary subsistence. The English gave this usage the sacred stamp of fashion; and from hence it is, that most of our terms of hunting are French. 'The reader will, I hope, give me his pardon for my freedom on this subject, since an ill accident, occasioned by hunting, has kept England in pain, these several months together, for one of the best and greatest peers * which she has bred for some ages ; no less illustrious for civil virtues and learning, than his ancestors were for all their victo- ries in France."
