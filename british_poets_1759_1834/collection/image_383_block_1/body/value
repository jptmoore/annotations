"Fear not that I shall watch, with servile shame, The’ imperious looks of some proud Grecian dame, Or, stooping to the victor’s lust, disgrace My goddess mother, or my royal race. And now, farewell ! the parent of the gods Restrains my fleeting soul in her abodes. I trust our common issue to your care.’ She said, and gliding pass'd unseen in air. I strove to speak : but horror tied my tongue ; And thrice about her neck my arms I flung, And, thrice deceiv'd, on vain embraces hung. Light as an empty dream at break of day, Or as a blast of wind, she rush’d away."
