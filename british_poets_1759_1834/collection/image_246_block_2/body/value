"He takes notice that Virgil is arraigned for plac- ing piety before valour, and making that piety the chief character of his hero. I have already said, from Bossu, that a poet is not obliged to make his hero a virtuous man; therefore,neither Homer nor \"Tasso are to be blamed, for giving what predomi- nant quality they pleased to their first character. But Virgil, who designed to form a perfect prince, and would insinuate that Augustus, whom he calls ZEneas in his poem, was traly such, found himself obliged to make him without blemish, thoroughly virtuous ; and a thorough virtue both begins and ends in piety. Tasso, without question, observed this before me, and therefore split his heroin two: he gave Godfrey piety, and Rinaldo fortitude, for their chief qualities or manners. Homer, who had chosen another moral, makes both Agamemnon and Achilles vicious; for Lis design was to instruct in virtue, by showing the deformity of vice. I avoid repetition of what I have said above. What follows, is translated literally from SÃ©grais."
