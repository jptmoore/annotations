"not thenlooked upon as avery oldman, who reached to a greater number of years than in these times an ancient family can reasonably pretend to ; and we know the names of several, who saw and practised the world for a longer space of time, than we can read the account of,inany one entire body of history. In short, they invented the most useful arts, pastu- rage, tillage, geometry, writing, music, astronomy, &c.; whilst the moderns, like extravagant heirs made rich by their industry, angratefully deride the good old gentlemen who left them the estate. Tt is not therefore to be wondered at, that pastorals are fallen into disesteem, together with that fashion of life upon which they were grounded. And me- thinks I see the reader already uneasy at this part of Virgil, counting the pages, and posting to the ZEmers : so delightful an entertainment is the very relation of public mischief and slaughter now be- come to mankind. And yet Virgil passed a much different judgment on his own works: he valued most this part, and his Georgics, and depended upon them for his reputation with posterity ; but censures himself in one of his letters to Augustus, for meddling with heroics, the invention of a de- generating age. This is the reason that the rules of pastoral are so little known or studied. Aris- totle, Horace, and the Essay of Poetry, take no notice of it: and monsienr Boilean (one of the most accurate of the moderns, because he never loses the ancients out of his sight) bestows scarce half a page on it."
