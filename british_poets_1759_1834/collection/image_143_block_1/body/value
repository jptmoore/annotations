"Choose first a place for such a purpose fit : There dig the solid earth, and sink a pit ; Next fill the hole with its own earth again, And trample with thy feet, and tread it in : Then, if it rise not to the former Leight Of superfice, conclude that soil is light, A proper ground for pasturage and vines. Baut, it the sullen earth, so press'd, repines â€˜Within its native mansion to retire, And stays withont, a heap of heayy mire, \"Tis good for arable, a glebe that asks Tough teams of oxen and laborious tasks."
