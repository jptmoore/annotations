"3arr'd from the male, is frantic with despair: For, when her pouting vent declares her pain, She tears the harness, and she rends the rein. For this, (when Venus gave them rage and power) Their masterâ€™s mangled members they devour, % Of love defrauded in their longing hour. For love, they force through thickets of the wood, They climb the steepy hills, and stem the flood."
