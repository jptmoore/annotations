"Who, when he saw the power of Troy decline, Forsook the weaker, with the strong to join— Broke every bond of nature and of truth, And murder’d, for his wealth, the royal youth. O sacred hunger of pernicious gold ; ‘What bands of faith can impious lucre hold ? Now, when my soul had shaken off her fears, I call my father, and the Trojan peers— Relate the prodigies of heaven—require What he commands, and their advice desire.- All vote to leave that execrable shore, Polluted with the blood of Polydore; But, ere we sail, his funeral rites prepare, Then, to his ghost, a tomb and altars rear. In mournful pomp the matrons walk the round, With baleful cypress and blue fillets crown'd, With eyes dejected, and with hair unbound. Then bowls of tepid milk and bicod we pour, And thrice invoke the soul of Polydore. Now, when the raging storms no longer reign, But southern gales invite us to the main, We launch our vessels, with a presperous wind, And leave the cities and the shores belind. An island in the /Egean main appears: Neptune and watery Doris claim it theirs, It floated once, till Pheebus fix'd the sides To rooted earth ; and now it braves the tides. Here, borne by friendly winds, we come ashore, l With needful ease our weary limbs restore, And the Sun's temple and his tewn adore. s Arius the priest and king, with laurel crown'd, His hoary locks with purple fillets bound, Who saw my sire the Deiian shore ascend, Came forth with eager haste to meet his friend ;"
