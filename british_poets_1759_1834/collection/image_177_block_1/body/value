"Salt herbage for the foddering rack provide, To fill their bags, and swell the milky tide. These raise their thirst, and to the taste restore The savour of the salt, on which they fed before. Some, when the kids their dams too deeply drain, With gags and muzzles their soft mouths restrain. Their morning milk the peasants press at night ; Their evening meal, before the rising light, To market bear or sparingly they steep With seasoning salt, and stor'd for winter keep.

With eries of hounds, thon may'st pursue the fear Of flying hares, and chase the fallow deer, Rouse from their desert dens the bristled rage Of boars, and beamy stags in toils engage. With smoke of burning cedar scent thy walls, And fume with stinking galbanum thy stalls, With that rank odour from thy dwelling-place To drive the viper'sbrood, and all the venom’d race: For often, under stalls unmov'd, they lie, Obscure inshades, andshunning heaven’s broad eye: And snakes, familiar, to the hearth succeed, Disclose their eggs, and near the chimney breed— Whether to roofy houses they repair, Or sun themselves abroad in open air, In all abodes, of pestilential kind To sheep and oxen, and the painful hind. Take, shepherd, take a plant of stabborn oak, And labour him with many a sturdy stroke,"
