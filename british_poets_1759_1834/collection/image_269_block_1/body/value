"action were owing to Homier, or any other poet. Itis one thing to copy, and another thing to imitate from natare. 'The copier is that servilé imitator, to whom Horace gives no better a name than that of animal ; he will not so much as allow himto be a man. Raphael imitated nature; they who copy one of Raphaels pieces, imitate but lim: for his work is their original. 'They translate him as I do Virgil ; and fall as short of him, as I of Virgil. There is a kind of invention in the imitation of Raphael ; for though the thing was in nature, yet the idea of it was his own. Ulysses travelled ; so did /Eneas: but neither of them were the first travellers ; for Cain went into the land of Neod, be- fore they were born : and neither of the poets-ever heard of such a man. If Ulysses had been killed at T'roy, yet Aneas must have gone to sea, or he could never have arrived in Italy. But the designs of the two poets were .as different as the courses of thieir heroes : one went home, and the other sought a home. To return to my first similitude—Sup- pose Apelles and Raphael had each of them painted a burning Troy ; might not the modern painter have succeeded as well as the ancient, though neither of them had seen the town on fire? for the draughts of both were taken from the ideas which they had of nature.  Cities had been burnt, before either of them were in being, Bat, to close the simile as I beganit; they would not have designed it after the same manner: Apelles would have dis- tinguished Pyrrhus from the rest of all the Gre- cians, and showed him forcing Lis entrance into Priam's palace ; there ke had set him in the fairest light, and given him the chief place of all hisfigures;"
