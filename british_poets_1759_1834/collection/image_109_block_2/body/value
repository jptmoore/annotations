"But Virgil seems no where so well pleased, as when he is got among his bees in the fourth Georgic ; and ennobles the actions of so trivial a creature, with metaphors drawn from the most im- portant concerns of mankind. His verses are not in a greater noise and hurry in the battles of Eneas and Turnus, than in the engagement of two swarms. And as, in his Eneis, he compares the labours of his Trojans to those of bees and pis- mires, here he compares the labours of the bees to those of the Cyclops. 1In short, the last Georgic was a good prelude to the Aneis, and very well showed what the poet could do in the description of what was really great, by his describing the mock-grandeur of an insect with so good a grace. There is more pleasantness in the little platform of a garden, which he gives us about the middle of this book, than in all the spacious walks and water-works of Rapin 2. 'The speech of Proteus, at the end, cannever be enough admired, and was indeed very fit to conclude so divine a work."
