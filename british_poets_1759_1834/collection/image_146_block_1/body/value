"The hurtful hazel in thy vineyard shun; Nor plant it to receive the setting sun; Nor break the topmost branches from the tree, Nor prune, with blunted knife, the progeny. Root up wild olives from thy labour’d lands ; For sparkling fire, from Linds’ unwary hands, Is often scatterd o'er their unctuous rinds, And after spread abroad by raging winds ; For first the smouldering flame the trunk receives; Ascending thence, it crackles in the leaves : At length victorious to the top aspires, Involving all the wood in smoky fires ; But most, when driven by winds, the flaming storm Of the long files destroys the beauteous form. In ashes then the' unhappy vineyard lies; Nor will the blasted plants from ruin rise ; Nor will the withex’d stock be green again; But the wild olive shoots, and shades the’ ungrateful plain. Be not seduc'd with wisdom’s empty shows, To stir the peaceful ground when Boreas blows. When winter frosts constrain the field with cold, The fainty root can take no steady hold, But, when the golden spring reveals the year, And the white bird returns, whom serpents fear, That season deem the best to plant thy vines: Next that, is when autumnal warmth declines, Ere heat is quite decay'd, or cold begun, Or Capricorn admits the winter sun, The spring adorns the woods, renews the leaves ; The womb of earth the genial sced receives : For then aimighty Jove descends, and pours Into his buxom bride his fruitful showers ; VOL.
