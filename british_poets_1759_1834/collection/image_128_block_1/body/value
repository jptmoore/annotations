"And owls, that mark the setting sun, declare A star-light evening, and a morning fair. Towering aloft, avenging Nisus flies, ‘While, dar’d, below the guilty Scylla lies. - Wherever frighted Scylla flies away, Swift Nisus follows, and pursues his prey : Where injur'd Nisus takes his airy course, Thence trembling Scylla flies, and shuns his force, This punishment pursues the’ unhappy maid, And thus the purple hair is dearly paid: - Then, thrice the ravens rend the liquid air, And croaking notes proclaim the settled fair. Then round their airy palaces they fly, To greet the sun ; and, seiz'd with secret joy, ‘When storms are overblown, with food repair To their forsaken nests, and callow care. Not that T think their breasts with heavenly souls Inspir'd, as man, who destiny controls. But, with the changeful temper of the skies, As rains condense, and sunshine rarefies, So turn the species in their alter’d minds, Compos'd by calms, and discompos’d by winds. From hence proceeds the birds’ harmonious voice ; From hence the cows exult, and frisking lambs Observe the daily circle of the sun, [rejoice. And the short year of each revolving moon : By them thou shalt foresee the following day ; Nor shall a starry night thy hopes betray. When first the moon appears, if then she shrouds Her silver crescent tipp'd with sable clouds, Conclude she bodes a tempest on the main, ?nd brews for fields impetuous floods of rain."
