"That basking in the sun thy bees may lie, And, resting there their flaggy pinions dry, When, late returning home, the laden host By raging winds is wreck'd upon the coast. Wild tiyme and savory set around their cell, Sweet to the taste, and fragrant to the smell : Set rows of rosemary with flowering stem, And let the purple violets drink the stream."
