"Nor in so vast a length onr serpents glide, Or rais’d on such a spiry volume ride. Next add our cities of illustrious name, Their costly labour and stupendous frame = Our forts on steepy hills, that far below See wanton streams in winding valleys flow ; Our twofold seas, that, washing either side, A rich recruit of foreign stores provide ; Our spacious lakes ; thee, Larius, first; and next Benacus, with tempestuous billows vex'd, Or shall I praise thy ports, or mention make Of the vast mound that binds the Lucrine lake? Or the disdainful sea, that shut from thence, Roars round the structure, and invades the fence, There, where secure the Julian waters glide, Or where Avernus’ jaws admit the Tyrrhene tide ? Our quarries, deep in earth, were fam’d of old For veins of silver, and for ore of gold. The’ inhabitants themselves their country grace: Hence rose the Marsian and Sabellian race, Strong-limb'd and stout, and to the wars inclin'd, And hard Ligurians, a laborious kind, And Volscians arm’d with iron-headed darts. Besides—an offspring of undaunted hearts— The Decii, Marii, great Camillus came From henee, and greater Scipio’s double name, And mighty Ceesar, whose victorious arms To farthest Asia carry fierce alarms, Avert unwarlike Indians from his Rome, Triumph abroad, secure our peace at home. Hail, sweet Saturnian soil ! of fruitful graia Great parent, greater of illustrious nien! For thee, my tuneful accents will I raise, And treat of arts disclos’d in ancient days,"
