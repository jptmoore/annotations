"ing and agreeable manner: for there are several ways of conveying the same truth to the mind of man ; and to choose the pleasantest of these ways, is that which chiefly distinguishes poetry from prose, and makes Virgil’s rules of husbandry plea- santer to read than Varro’s. Where the prose- writer tells us plainly what ought to be done, the poet often conceals the precept in a description, and represents his countryman performing the ac- tion in which he would instruct his reader. Where the one sels out, as fully and distinctly as he can, all the parts of the truth which he wounld commu- nicate to us, the other singles out the most pleasing circumstance of this truth, and so conveys the whole in 2 more diverting manner to the under- standing. I shall give one instance, out of a mul- titude of this nature that might be found in the Georgics, where the reader may see the different ways Virgil has taken to express the same thing, and how much pleasanter every manner of expres- sion is, than the plain and direct mention of it would have been. It is in the second Georgic, where he tells us what trees will bear grafting on €ach other."
