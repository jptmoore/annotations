"Or with hard stones demolish from afar His haughty crest, the seat of all the war; Invade his hissing throat, and winding spires ; Till, stretch'd in length, theâ€™ unfolded foe retires. He drags his tail, and for his head provides, And in some secret cranny slewly glides ; But leaves, expos'd to blows, his back and bat- ter'd sides."
