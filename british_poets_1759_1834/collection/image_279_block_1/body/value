"If therefore Ilioneus, according to our supposition, understand the heliacal rising of Orion, Anna must mean the achronical, which the different epithets given to that consteilation seem to manifest. Ilio- neus calls him nimbosus; Anna, aquosus. He is tempestuous in the summer, when he rises heliacal- ly ; and rainy in the winter, when he rises achroni- cally. Your lordship will pardon me for the fre- quent repetition of these cant words, which I could notavoid in this abbreviation of SÃ©grais, who, I think, deserves no little commendation in this new criticism."
