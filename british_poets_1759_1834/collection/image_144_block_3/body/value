"Choose next a province for thy vineyard’s reign, On hills above, or in the lowly plain. If fertile fields or valleys be thy choice, Plant thick ; for bounteous Bacchus will rejoice In close plantations there : but if the vine On rising ground be plac'd, or hills supine, Extend thy loose battalions largely wide, Opening thy ranks and files on either side, But marshal’d all in order as they stand ; And let no soldier straggle from his band."
