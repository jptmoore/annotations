The fatter earth by handling we may find, With ease distinguisld from the meagre kind ; Poor soil will crumble into dust ; the rich Will to the fingers cleave like clammy pitch : Moist earth produces corn and grass, but both Too rank and too luxuriant in their growth. Let not my land so large a promise boast, Lest the rank ears in length of stem be lost. The heayier earth is by her weight betray'd ; The lighter in the poising hand is weigh'd,"
