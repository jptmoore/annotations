"mere fustian, (as Horace would tell you from be- hind, without pressing forward,) and more smoke than fire. Pulci, Boiardo, and Ariosto, would ery out, ¢ make room for the Italian poets, the de- scendants of Virgil in a right line: father Le Moine, with his Saiut Louis; and Scudery with his Alaric, for a godly king and Gotliic conqueror ; and Chapelain would take it ill that his ¢ Maid @ should be refused a place with Helen and Lavinia, Spenser has a better plea for his Fairy-Queen, had his action been finished, or had been one; and Milton, if the devil had not been his hero, instead of Adam ; if the giant had not foiled the knight, and driven him out of his strong hold, to wander through the world with his lady errant ; and if there had net been more machining persons than human in his poem. After these, the rest of our English poets shall not be mentioned. I have that honour for them which I ought to have; bat, if they are worthies, they are not to be ranked amongst the three whom I have named, and who are estahlhhed in their reputation."
