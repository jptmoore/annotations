"which makes this accusation look so strange at tae first sight, is, that he has borrowed so many things from Homer, Apollonius Rhodius, and others who preceded him. But, in the first place, if inven- tion is to be takenin so strict a sense, that the matter of a poem must be wholly new, and that in all its parts ; then Scaliger hath made out, saith SÃ©grais, that the history of Troy was no more the invention of Homer, than of Virgil. There was not an old woman, or almost a child, but had it in their mouths, before the Greek poet or his friends di- gested it into this admirable order in which we read it. At this rate, as Solomon hath told us, there is nothing new beneath the sun. Who then can pass for an inventor, if Homer, as well as Virgil, must be deprived of that glory? Is Ver- sailles the less a new building, because the archi- tect of that palace hath imitated others which were built before it? Walls, doors, and windows, apart- ments, offices, rooms of convenience and magnifi- cence, are in all great houses. So descriptions, figures, fables, and the rest, must be in all heroic poems : they are the common materials of poetry, furnished from the magazine of nature ; every poet hath as much right to them, as every man hath to air or water."
