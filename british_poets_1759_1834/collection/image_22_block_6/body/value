"Thus Linus too began his poem, as appears by a fragment of it preserved by Diogenes Laertius; and the like may be instanced in Musaus himselfâ€™; so that our poet here, with great judgment, (asal- ways,) follows the ancient custom of beginning their more solemn songs with the creation; and does it too most properly under the person of a shepherd. And thus, the first and best employ- ment of poetry was, to compose hymns in honour of the great Creator of the universe."
