"These are the criticisms of most moment which have been made against the /Eneis by the ancients or moderns. As for the particnlar exceptions against this or that passage, Macrobius and Pon- tanus have answered them already. If I desired to appear more learned than Iam, it had been as easy for me to have taken their objections and solutions, as it is for a country parson to take the expositions of the fathers out of Junius and Tremellius, and not to have named the authors from whence T had them: for so Ruaus (otherwise a most judicious commentator on Virgil's works) has used Pontanus, his greatest benefactor; of whom bhe is very silent; and I do not remember that he once cites him."
