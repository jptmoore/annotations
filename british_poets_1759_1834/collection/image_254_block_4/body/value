"I need say no more in justification of our heroâ€™s courage, and am much deceived, if he ever be at- tacked on this side of his character again. But he is arraigned with more show of reason by the ladies;; who will make a numerous party aganst him, for being false to love, in forsaking Dido. And I can- not much blame them; for to say the truth, it is an ill precedent for their gallasts to follow. Yet, if I can bring him off with fiying colours, they may learn experience at her cost, and, for her sake, avoid a cave, as the worst sheiter they can choose from a shower of rain ; especially, when they Lave a lover in their company."
