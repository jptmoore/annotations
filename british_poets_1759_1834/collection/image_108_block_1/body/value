"greater boldness in its metaphors, than any of the rest. The poet, witha great beauty, applies ob- livion, ignorance, wonder, desire, and the like, to his trees. The last Georgic has indeed as many metaphors, but not so daring as this; for human thoughts and passions may be more naturally ascribed to a bee, than to an inanimate plant. He who reads over the pleasures of a country life, as they are described by Virgil in the latter end of this book, can scarce be of Virgil's mind in pre- ferring even the life of a philosopher to it."
