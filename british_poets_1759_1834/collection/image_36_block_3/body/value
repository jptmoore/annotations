"The judicions Mallierbe exploded this sort of verse near eighty years ago. Nor can I forbear wondering at that passage of a famous academi- cian, in which he, most compassionately, excuses the ancients for their not being so exact in their compositions as the modern French, because they wanted a dictionary, of which the French are at last happily provided. If Demosthenes and Cicero had been so lucky as to have had a dictionary, and such a patron as cardinal Richelieu, perhaps they might have aspired to the honour of Balzac’s le- gacy of ten pounds, Le prix de Uéloguence."
