"The poet, in the beginning of this book, propounds the general design of each Georgic : and, after a solemn invocation of all the gods who are any way related to bis sabject, he addresses hiwself in particnlar to Aogustus, whom he complinsents with divinity ; and after strikes into his business. e shows the different kinds of tillage proper to different soils, traces out the original of agriculture, gives a catalogne of the hus- bandman’s tools, specifies the employinents peculiar to each season, describes the changes of the weather, with the signs in heaven and earth that forebode them; iustances many of the prodigies that happened near the time of Julius Csar’s death ; and shuts up all with a supplication to the gods for the safety of Augustus, and the preservation of Rome."
