"MENALCAS. Begin you first ; if either Alcon’s praise, Or dying Phyllis, have inspir’d your lays : If her yon mourn, or Codrus you commend, Begin ; and Tityrus your flock shall tend. MOPSUS.

She sigh’d, she sobb'd ; and, furious with despair, She rent her garments, and she-tore her hair, Accusing all the gods, and every star. The swains forgot their sheep, nor near the brink Of running waters brought their herds to drink. - The thirsty cattle, of themselves, abstain’d From water, and their grassy fare disdain’d. The death of Daphnis woods and hills deplore ; They cast the sound to Libya’s desert shore ; The Libyan lions hear, and hearing roar."
