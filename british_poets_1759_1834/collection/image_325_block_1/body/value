"Nor ceas'd his arrows, till the shady plain Seven mighty bodies with their blood distain. For the seven ships he made an equal share, And to the port return'd, triumphant from the war. The jars of generous wine (Acestes’ gift, When his Trinacrian shores the navy left) He set abroach, and for the feast prepar'd, In equal portions with the venison shar'd. Thus, while he dealt it round, the pious chief; With cheerful words allay’'d the common grief :— ¢ Endure, and conquer: Jove will soon dispose, To future good, our past and present woes. ‘With me, the rocks of Scylla you have tried : The’ inhuman Cyclops, and his den defied. What greater ills hereafter can you bear! Resume your courage and dismiss your care. An hour will come, with pleasure to relate Your sorrows past, as benefits of Fate. Through various hazards and events, we move To Latium, and the realms foredoom’d by Jove. Call’d to the seat (the promise of the skies) ‘Where Trojan kingdoms once again may rise, Endure the hardships of your present state ; Live, and reserve yourself for better fate.’"
