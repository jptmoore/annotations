"I think nothing, which is a phrase or saying in common talk, should be admitted into a serious poem ; because it takes off from the solemnity of the expression, and gives it too great a turn of fa- miliarity. Much less ought the low phrases and ternis of art, that are adapted to husbandry, have any place in such a work as the Georgic ; which is not to appear in the natural simplicity and naked- ness of its subject, but in the pleasantest dress that poetry can bestow on it. Thus Virgil, to deviate from the common form of words, would not make use of tempore but sidere in his first verse, and every where else abounds with metaphors, Gre- cisms, and circumlocutions, to give his verse the greater pomp, and preserve it from sinking into a plebeian style. And herein consists Virgil's masterpiece, who has not only excelled all other poets, but even himself, in the language of his Georgics, where we receive more strong and lively ideas of things from his words, than we could have done from the objects themselves ; and find our imaginations more affected by his descrip- tions, than they would have been by the very sight of what he describes."
