"A peopled city made a desert place ; All that I saw, and part of which I was ; Not even the hardest of our foes could hear, Nor stern Ulysses tell, without a tear.

But, since you take such interest in our woe, And Troy's disastrous end desire to know, I will restrain my tears, and briefly tell â€˜What in our last and fatal night befel."
