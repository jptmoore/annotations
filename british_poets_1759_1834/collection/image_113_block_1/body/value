"The watery virgins for thy bed shall strive, And Tethys all her waves in dowry give. Or wilt thou bless our summers with thy rays, And, seated near the Balance, poise the days, Where, in the void of heaven, a space is free, Betwixt the Scorpion and the Maid, for thee? The Scorpion, ready to receive thy laws, Yields half his region, and contracts his claws. Whatever part of heaven thou shalt obtain (For let not hell presume of such a reign ; Nor let so dire a thirst of empire move Thy mind to leave thy kindred gods above: Though Greece admires Elysium’s bless'd retreat, Though Proserpine affects her silent seat, And, importun'd by Ceres to remove, Prefers the fields below to those above), Be thou propitious, Cesar! guide my course, And to my bold endeavours add thy force : Pity the poet's and the pleughman’s cares; Interest thy greatness in our mean affairs, And use thyself betimes fo hear and grant om's prayers."
