"The world another Sophocles in thee, Another Homer should behold in me. Amidst thy laurels let this ivy twine : Thine was my earliest muse ; my latestshall be thine. Scarce from the world the shades of night with- drew, Scarce were the flocks refresh'd with morning dew, ‘When Damon, stretch’d beneath an olive shade, And wildly staring upwards, thus inveigh'd Against the conscious gods, and curs'd the cruel maid: ¢ Star of the morning, why dost thou delay ? Come, Lucifer, drive on the lagging day, While I my Nisa’s perjurd faith deplore— Witness, ye powers, by whom she falsely swore ! The gods, alas ! are witnesses in vain ; Yet shall my dying breath to heaven complain. Begin with me, my flute, the sweet M=znalian strain. ¢ The pines of Mznalus, the vocal grove, Are ever full of verse, and full of love : They hear the hinds, they hear theirgod complain, Whio suffer’d not the reeds to rise in vain. Begin with me, my flute, the sweet Menalian strain. ¢ Mopsus triumphs ; he weds the willing fair. ‘When such is Nisa's choice, what lover can despair ? Now grifious join with mares ; another age Shall see the hound and hind their thirst assuage, Promiscuous at the spring. Prepare the lights, O Mopsus ! and perform the bridal rites. Scatter thy nuts among the scrambling boys : Thine is the night, and thine the nuptial joys. For thee the sun declines: O happy swain ! Beginwith me, my flute, the sweet Manalian strain."
