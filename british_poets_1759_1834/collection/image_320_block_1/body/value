"Raise all thy winds: with night involve the skies; Sink or disperse my fatal enemies. Twice seven, the charming daughters of the main, ¢ Around my person wait, and bear my train:” Succeed my wish, and second my design, \"The fairest, Deiopeia, shall be thine, And make thee fathier of a happy line."
