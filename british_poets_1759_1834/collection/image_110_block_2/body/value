"T shall not here compare the style of the Georgics with that of Lucretivs (which the reader may see already done Â° in the preface to the second volume of Miscellany Poems), but shall conclude this poem to be the most complete, elaborate, and finished piece of all antiquity. The ZEneis indeed is of a nobler kind ; but the Georgic is more perfect in its kind. The Aneis has a greater variety of beau- ties in it; but those of the Georgic are more ex- quisite.  In short, the Georgic has all the perfec- tion that can be expected in a poem written by the greatest poct in the flower of his age, when his invention was ready, his imagination warm, his Jjudgment settled, and all his faculties in their tuil vigour and maturity."
