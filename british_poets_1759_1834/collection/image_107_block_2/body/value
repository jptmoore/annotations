"Virgil has drawn out the rules of tillage and planting into two books, which Hesiod has dispatch- ed in half a one; but has so raised the natural rudeness and simplicity of his subject with such a significancy of expression, such a pomp of verse, such variety of transitions, and such a so- lemn air in his reflections, that, if we look on both poets together, we see in one the plainness of a downriglit countryman, and, in the other, some- thing of a rustic majesty, like that of a Roman dictator at the plongh-tail. He delivers the mean- est of his precepts with a kind of grandeur: he breaks the clods, and tosses the dung about, with an air of gracefulness. His prognostications of the weather are taken out of Aratus, where we may see how judiciously he has picked out those that are most proper for his husbandmanâ€™s observation ; how he has enforced the expression, and heighten- ed the images, which he found in the oviginal."
