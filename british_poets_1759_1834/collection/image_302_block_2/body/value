"When I mentioned the Pindaric line, I should have added, that I take another licence in my verses: for I frequently make use of triplet rhymes, and for the same reasonâ€”because they bound the sense. And therefore I generally join these two Ji- cences together, and make the last verse of the tri- plet a Pindaric : for, besides the majesty which it gives, it cenfines the sense within the barriers of three lines, which would languish if it were length- ened info four. Spenser is my example for both these privileges of English verses ; and Chapman has followed hiin in his translation of Homer. Mr. Cowley has given into them after both; and all suc- ceeding writers after him. I regard them now as the Magna Charta of heroic poetry, and am tod much an Englishman to lose what my ancestors bave gained for me. Let the French and Italians value themselves on their regularity : strength and eleva- tion are our standard. I said before, and I repeat it, that the affected purity of the French has unsi- newed their heroic verse. The language of an epic poem is almost wholly figurative : yet they are so fearful of a metaphor, that no example of Virgil can encourage them to be bold with safety. Sure they might warm themselves by that sprightly blaze,"
