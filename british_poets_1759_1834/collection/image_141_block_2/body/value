"The nature of the several soils now see, Their strength, their colour, their fertility : And first for heath, and barren hilly ground, ‘Where meagre clay and flinty stones abound, Where the poor soil all succour seems to want— Yet this suffices the Palladian plant. Undoubted signs of such a soil are found ; l For here wild olive-shoots o’erspread the ground, And heaps of berries strew the fields around. s But, where the soil, with fattening moisture fili'd, Is clotl’d with grass, ard fruitful to be till'd, Such as in cheerful vales we view from high, Which dripping rocks with rolling streams supply, And feed with ooze ; where rising hillecks run In length, and open to the southern sun ; Where fern succeeds, ungrateful to the plough— That gentle ground to generous grapes allow. Strong stocks of vines it will in time produce, And overflow the vats with friendly juice, Such as our priests in golden goblets pour To gods, the givers of the cheerful hour, Then when the bloated Tuscan blows his horn, And reeking entrails are in chargers borne."
