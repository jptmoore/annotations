"And swell'd, with raging storms, the peaceful flood ; Lommission’d hungry wolves to’ infest the fold, And shook from oaken leaves the liquid gold ; Remov'd from human reach the cheerful fire, And from the rivers bade the wine retire : That studious need might useful arts explore ; From furrew'd fields to reap the foodful stere, And force the veins of clashing flints to’ expire The lurking seeds of their celestial fire."
