"Two young shepherds, Chromis and Mnasylus, having been often promised a song by Silenns, chance to catch him asleep in this pastoral; where they bind hitn hand and foot, and then claim his promise. Silenus, finding they woald be put off no longer, begins his song, in which he describes the formation of the universe, and the original of animals, according to the Epicurean philosophy ; and then runs through the most surprising transformations which have happened in Nature since ber birth.

Silenus acts as tator, Chronis and Mnasylus as the two pupilz."
