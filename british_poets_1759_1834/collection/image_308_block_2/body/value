"Lay by Virgil, I beseech your lordship, and all my better sort of judges, when you take my ver- sion; and it will appear a passable beauty when the original Muse is absent. But, like Spenser’s false Florimel made of snow, it melts and vanishes when the true one comes in sight. T will not ex- cuse but justify myself for one pretended crime, with which I am liable to be charged by false critics, not only in this translation, but in many of my original poems—that I latinize too much. It is true, that, when 1 find an English word significant -and sounding, I neither borrow from the latin nor any other language ; but, when I want at home, I must seek abroad."
