"Should near their folds his feeding flocks restrain. For, ere the rising winds begin to roar, The working seas advance to wash the shore : Soft whispers run along the leafy woods ; And mountains whistle to the murmuring floods. E'en then the doubtful billows scarce abstain From the toss'd vessel on the troubled main ; When crying cormorants forsake the sea, And, stretching to the covert, wing their way ; When sportful coots run skimming oâ€™er the strand; When watchful herons leave their watery stand, And, mounting upward with erected flight, Gain on the skies, and soar above the sight. And oft, before tempestuous winds arise, The seeming stars fall headlong from the skies, And, shooting through the darkness, gild the night With sweeping glories, and long trails of light ; And chaff with eddy-winds is whirl'd around, And dancing leaves are lifted from the ground ; And floating feathers on the waters play. But, when the winged thunder takes his way From the cold north, and east and west engage, And at their frontiers meet with equal rage, The clouds are crush'd : a glut of gather'd rain The hollow ditches fills, and floats the plain ; } And sailors furl their dropping sheets amain."
