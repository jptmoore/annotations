"are see that the credit, not only of banks, but of exchequers, cracks, when little comes in, and much goes out. Virgil calied upon me in every line for some new word; and I paid so long, that I was almost bankrupt: so that the latter end must needs be more burdensome than the beginuing or the middle ; and consequently the twelfth Lneid cost me double the time of the first and secend. What had become of me, if Virgil had taxed me with another book? I had certainly been reduced to pay the public in hammered monecy, for want of milled; that is, in the same old words which I had used before: and the receivers must have been forced to have taken any thing, where tlicre was so little to be had."
