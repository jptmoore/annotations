"M. Foutenelle seems a little defective in this point : he brings in a pair of shepherdesses dis- puting very warmly, whether Vicioria be a god- dess or a woman. Her great condescension and compassion, her affability and goodness, (none of the nieanest attributes of tlie divinity,) pass for convincing arguments that she could not possibly be a goddess."
