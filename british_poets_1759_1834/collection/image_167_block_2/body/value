"If to the warlike steed thy studies bend, Or for the prize in chariots to contend, Near Pisa’s lood the rapid wheels to guide, Or in Olympian groves aloft to ride, The generous labours of the courser first, Must be with sight of arms and sounds of trumpets Inur'd the groaning axle-tree to hear; [nursd ; And let him ¢lashing whips in stables hear. Soothe him with praise, and make him understand The loud applauses of his master’s hand : This, from his weaning, let him well be taught; And then betimes in a soft snaffle wrought, Eefore his tender joints with nerves are knit, Untried in arms, and trembling at the bit. But, when to four full springs his years advance, Teach him to run the round, with pride to prance And (rightly manag’d) equal time to beat, To tarn, to bound in measure, and curvet. Let himn to this, with easy pains, be broaght, And seem to labour when he labours not. Thus form’d for speed, he challenges the wind, And leaves the Scythian arrow far behind : He scours along the field, with loosen’d reins, And treads so light, he scarcely prints the plains;."
