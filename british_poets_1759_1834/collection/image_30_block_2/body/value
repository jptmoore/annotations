"A fifth rule (which one may hope will not be eontested) is, that the writer should show in his compositions some competent skill of the subject matter, that which makes the character of persons introduced. 1In this, as in all other points of learning, decency, and economy of a poem, Virgil much excels his master Theocritus. The poet is better skiiled in husbandry than those that get their bread by it. He describes the mnature, the diseases, the remedies, the proper places, and seasons, of feeding, of watering their flocks; the furniture, diet, the lodging and pastimes, of his shepherds. But the persons brought in by M. Fontenelle are shepherds in masquerade, and handle their sheep-hook as awkwardly as they do their oaten reed. They saunter about with their chers moutons ; but they relate as little to the business in hand, as the painterâ€™s dog, or a Dutch ship, docs to the history designed. One would suspect some of them, that instead of leading out their sheep into the piains of Mont Brison and Marcilli, to the flowery banks of Lignon, or the Charante, they are driving directly @ la boucherie, to make money of them. I hope hereafter M, Fontenelle will choose his servants better."
