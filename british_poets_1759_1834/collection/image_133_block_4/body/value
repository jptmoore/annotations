"The subject of the following book is planting : in handling of which argument, the poet shows all the ditferent methods of raising trees, describes their variety, and gives rules for the management of each in particular. He then points out the soils in which the several plants thrive best, and thence takes occasion to run ont into the praises of Italy : after which he gives some directions for discovering the nature of every soil, prescribes rules for dressing of vines, olives, &c. and concludes the Georgic with a panegyric on a conn- try life."
