"Mann'd once again, another plant I try : That other gush’d with the same sanguine dye, Then fearing guilt for some offence unknown, With prayers and vows the Dryads T atone, With all the sisters of the woods, and most The god of arms, who rules the Thracian coast— That they, or he, these omens would avert, Release our fears, and better signs impart. Clear'd, as I thought, and fully fix’d at length To learn the cause, I tugg’d with all my strength ; I bent my knees against the ground: once more The violated myrtle ran with gore. Scarce dare I tell the sequel: from the womb Of wounded earth, and caverns of the tomb, A groan, as of a troubled ghost, renew'd My fright, and then these dreadful words ensued ; ¢ Why dost thou thus my buried body rend? O spare the corpse of thy unhappy friend! Spare to poilute thy pious hands with blood: The tears distil not from the wounded wood But every drop this living tree contains, Is kindred blood, and ran in Trojan veins, O! fly from this unhospitable shore, Warn'd by my fate; for I am Polydore! Here loads of lances, in my blood embrued, Again shoot upward, by my blood renew'd.’"
