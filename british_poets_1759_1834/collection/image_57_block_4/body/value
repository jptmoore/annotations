"MENALCAS. SincE on the downs our flocks together feed, And since my voice can match your tuneful reed, Wiy sit we not beneath the grateful shade, Which hazles, intermix'd with elms, have made?

Your merit and your years command the choice ; Amyntas only rivals you in voice. MOPSUS. â€˜What will not that presuniing shepherd dare, Who thinks his veice with Pheebus may compare ?"
