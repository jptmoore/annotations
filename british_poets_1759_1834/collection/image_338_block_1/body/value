"‘Thus while the Trojan prince employs his eyes, Fix'd on the walls with wonder and surprise, The beauteous Dido, with a numerous train, And pomp of guards, ascends the sacred fane. Such on Eurotas’ banks, or Cynthus’ height, Diauna seems : and so she charms tiie sight, When in the dance the graceful goddess leads The choir of nymphs, and overtops their heads. Known by her quiver, and her lofty mien, She walks majestic, and she looks their queen : Latona sees her shine above the rest, And feeds with secret joy her silent breast. Such Dido was ; with such becoming state, Amidst the crowd, she walks serenely great, Their labour to her future sway she speeds, And passing with a gracious glance proceeds, Then mounts the throne,highplac’d before the shrine; In crowds around, the swarming people join, She takes petitions, and dispenses laws, Hears and determines every private cause : Their tasks in equal portions she divides, And, where unequal, there by lot decides. Another way by chance Aueas bends His eyes, and unexpected sees his friends, Antheus, Sergestus grave, Cioanthus strong, And at their backs a mighty Trojan throng, Whom late the tempest on the billows toss'd, And widely scatter'd on another coast. The prince, unseen, surpris'd with wonder stands, And longs, with joyful haste, to jomn their hands: Bat, doubtful of the wish'd event, he stays, And from the hollow cloud his friends surveys, Tmpatient till they told their present state, And where they left their ships, and what thejr fate, YOL.
