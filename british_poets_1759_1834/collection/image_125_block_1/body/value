"Earth feels the motions of ler angry god ; Her entrails tremble, and her mountains nod ; % And flying beasts in forests seek abode : b Deep horror seizes every human breast ; Their pride is humbled, and their fear confess'd, While he from high his rolling thunder throws, And fires the mountains with r√©peated blows : The rocks are from their old foundations rent ; The winds redouble, and the rains augment : The waves on heaps are dash'd agzinst the shore ; And now the woods, and now the billows, roar."
