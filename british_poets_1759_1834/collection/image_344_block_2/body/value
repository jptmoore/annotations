"The good Aneas; whose paternal care Tiilus’ absence could no longer bear, Dispatch'd Achates to the ships in haste, To give a glad relation of the past, And, fraught with precious gifts, to bring the boy Snatch’d from the ruins of unhappy Troy— A robe of tissue, stiff with goiden wire ; An upper vest, once Helen's rich attire, From Argos by the fam'd adultress brought, With golden flowers and winding foliage wrought— Her mother Leda’s present, when she came To ruin Troy, and set the world on flame ; The sceptre Priam’s eldest daughter bore, Her orient necklace, and the crown she wore Of double texture, glorious to behold; One order set with gems, and one with geld. Instructed thus, the wise Achates goes, And, in his diligenee, bis duty shows."
