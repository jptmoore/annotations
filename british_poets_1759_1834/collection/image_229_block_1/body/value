"brought by Aristotle on the other side, and set in the fairest light by Dacier. ButI suppose, without looking on the book, I may have touched on some of the objections : for, iu this address to your lord- ship, I design not a treatise of heroic poetry, but write in a loose epistolary way ; somewlat tending to that subject, after the example of Horace, in Lis first epistle of the second book to Augustus Caesar, and in that to the Pisos, which we call his ¢ Art of Poetry; in both of which he observes no method that T can trace, whatever Scaliger the father or Heinsius may have seen, or rather think they had seen. I have taken up, laid down, and resumed as often as I pleased, the same subject : and this loose proceeding I shall use through all this prefatory dedication. Yet all this while I have been sailing with some side-wind or other toward the point I proposed in the beginning ;—the great- ness and excellency of an heroic poem, with some of the difficulties which attend that work. The comparison, therefore, which I made betwixt the epopee and the tragedy, was not altogether a di- gression ; for it is concluded on ali hands, that they are both the master-pieces of human wit."
