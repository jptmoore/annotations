"Ronsard, and the rest whom Ségrais names, who are of cpinion that the action of this poem takes up almost a year and half, ground their calcula- tion thus. Anchises died in Sicily at the end of winter, or beginning of the spring. /Eneas, im- mediately after the interment of his father, puts to sea for Italy. He is surprised by the tempest de- scribed in the beginning of the first book ; and there it is that the scene of the poem opens, and where the action must commence. He is driven by this storm on the coasts of Afric: he stays at Carthage all that summer and almost all the winter fo]low1ng, sets sail again for Italy just before the beginning of the spring ; meets with contrary winds, and makes Sicily the second time. This part of the action completes the year. Then he celebrates the anniversary of his father's funeral, and shortly after arrives at Cume ; and from thence his time is taken up in his first treaty with Latinus, the overture of the war, the siege of his camp by Turnus, his going for succours to relieve it, his return, the rais- ing of the siege by the first battle, the twelve days’ truce, the second battle, the assault of Laurentum, and the single fight with Turnus ; all which, they say, cannot take up less than four or five months more; by which account, we cannot suppose the entire action to be contained in a much less coms ; ss than a year and half,"
