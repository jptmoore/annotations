"And, when cold winter split the rocks in twain, And ice the running rivers did restrain, He stripp’d the bear’s-foot of its leafy growth, And, calling western winds, accus'd the spring of sloth. He therefore first among the swains was found To reap the proeduct of his labour’d ground, Andsqueeze the combswith goldenliquor erown’d. His limes were first in flowers : his lofty pines, With friendly shade, secur'd his tender vines. . For every bloom his trees in spring afford, - An autumn apple was by tale restor'd, He knew to rank his elms in even rows, For fruit the grafted pear-tree to dispose, % And tame to plums the sourness of thg sloes. With spreading planes he made a cool retreat, To shade good fellows from the summer’s heat. Baut straitew’d in my space, I must forsake, This task, for others afterwards to take. Describe we next the nature of the bees, Bestow’d by Jove for secret services, When, by the tinkling sound of timbrels led, The king of heaven in Cretan caves they fed. Of all the race of animals alone T'he bees have common cities of their own, And common sons : beneath one law they live, And with one common stock their traffic drive. Each has a certain home, a several stall ; All is the state’s ; the state provides for all. Mindful of coming cold, they share the pain ; And heard, for winter’s use, the summer’s gain. Some o'er the public magazines preside ; And some are sent new forage to provide."
