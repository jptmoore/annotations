"Ere the licentious youth be thus restraind, Or moral precepts on their minds have gain'd, Their wanton appetites not only feed With delicates of leaves, and marshy weed, But with thy sickle reap the rankest land, And minister the blade with bounteous hand : Nor be with harmful parsimony won \"To follow what our homely sires have done; Who fill'd the pail with beestings of the cow; But all her udder to the calf allow."
