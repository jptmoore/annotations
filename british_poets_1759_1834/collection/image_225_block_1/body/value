"cured by alteratives : wherein, though purges are sometimes necessary, yet diet, good air, and mo- derate exercise, have the greatest part. The mat- ter being thus stated, it will appear that both sorts of poetry are of use for their proper ends. The stage is more active : the epic poem works at greater leisure, yet is active too, when need re- quires: for dialogue is imitated by the drama, from the more active parts of it. One puts off a fit, like the quinquina, and relieves us only for a time ; the other roots out the distemper, and gives a healthful habit. The sun enlightens and cheers us, dispels fogs, and warms the ground with his daily beams ; but the corn is sowed, increases, is ripened, and is reaped for use in process of time, and in its proper season. I proceed, from the greatness of the action, to the dignity of the actors ; I mean the persons employed in both poems. There, likewise, tragedy will be seen to borrow from the epopee ; and that which borrows is always of less dignity, because it has not of its own. A subject, it is true, may lend to his sovereign: but the act of borrowing makes the king inferior ; because he wants and the subject supplies.
