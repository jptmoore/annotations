"kind of poetry? What theme more fit for the song of a god, or to imprint religions awe, than the om- nipotent power of transforming the species of creatures at their pleasure ? Their families lived in groves, near the clear springs; and what better warning could be given to the hopeful young shepherds, than that they should not gaze too much into the liquid dangerous leoking-glass, for fear of being stolen by the water-nymphs ; that is, falling and being drowned, as Hylas was? Pasi- phaé’s monstrous passion for a bull is certainly a subject enough fitted for bucolics. Can M. Fon- tenelle tax Silenus for fetching too far the trans- formation of the sisters of Phaéton into trees, when perhaps they sat at that very time under the hospitable shade of those alders and poplars ;—or the metamorphosis of Philomela into that ravish- ing bird, which makes the sweetest music of the groves? If he had looked into the ancient Greek writers, or so much as consulted honest Servius, he would have discovered, that under the allegory of this drunkenness of Silenus, the refinement and exultation of men’s minds by philosophy was intended. But, if the author of these reflections can take such flights in his wine, it is almost pity that drunkenness should be a sin, or that he should ever want good store of Burgundy and Cham- paign. Baut indeed he seems not to have ever drank out of Silenus’s tankard, when he composed either his Critique or Pastorals."
