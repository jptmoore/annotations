"There has been abundance of criticism spent on Virgil's Pastorals and /Eneids: but the Georgics are a subject which none of the critics have suffi- ciently taken into their consideration; most of them passing it over in silence, or casting it under the same head with pastoral ; a division by no means proper, unless we suppose the style of a husbandman ounght to be imitated in a georgic, as that of a shepherd is in a pastoral.
