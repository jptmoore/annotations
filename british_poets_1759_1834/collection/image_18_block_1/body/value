"Olympias did the same for Alexander the Great. Nor will he wonder that the Romans, in great exi- gency, sent for their dictator from the plough, whose whole estate was but of four acres; too little a spot now for the orchard or kitchen-garden of a private gentleman. It is commonly known, that the founders of three the most renowned monarchies in the world were shepherds: and the subject of husbandry has been adorned by the writings and labour of more than twenty kings. It ought not, * therefore, to be matter of surprise to a modern writer, that kings (the shepherds of the people in Homer,) laid down their first rudiments in tending their mute subjects; nor that the wealth of Ulysses consisted in flocks and herds ; the intendants over which were then in equal esteem with officers of state in iatter times. And therefore Eumwus is called Jioz ยง@opSo; in Homer ; not so much because Homer was a lover of a country life, to which he rather seems averse, but by reason of the dignity and greatuess of his trust, and because he was the son of a king, stolen away, and sold by the Phce- nician pirates; which the ingenious Mr. Cowley seems not to have taken notice of. Nor will 1t seem strange, that the master of the horse to king T.atinus, in the ninth /Eneid, was found in the home- ly employment of cleaving blocks, when news of the first skirmish betwixt the Trojans and Latins was brought to him."
