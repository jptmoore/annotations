"Janguage ; since the French and the Italians, as well as we, are yet ignorant what feet are to be used in heroic poetry; since I have not strictly observed those rules myself, which I can teach others; since 1 pretend to no dictatorship ameng my fellow-poets ; since, if I should instruct some of them to make well-running verses, they want genius to give them strength as well as sweetness ; and, above all, since your lordship has advised me not to publish that little which I know, I look on your counseias your eommand, which I shall observe inviolably, till you shall please to revoke it, and leave me at liberty to make my thoughts public. In the meantime, that I may arrogate nothing to myself, I must ae- knowledge that Virgil in Latin, and Spenser in Eng- lish, have been my masters. Spenser has also given me the boldness to make use sometimes of his Alexandrine line, which we call, thongh impro- - perly, the Pindaric, because Mr. Cowley lias often ‘employed it in his odes. It adds a certain majesty ‘to the verse, when it is used with judgment, and stops the sense from overflowing into another line. Formerly the French, like us, and the Italians, bad but five feet, or ten syllables, in their heroic verse; but, since Ronsard’s time, (as I suppose) they found their tongue too weak to support their epic poetry, _without the addition of another foot. That indeed had given it somewhat of the run and measure of a trimeter; but it runs with more activity than ‘strength : their language is not strung with sinews, like our English: it has the nimbleness of a grey- ‘hound, but not the bulk and body of a mastiff, Our men and our verses overbear them by their weight; and Pondere, non numero,is the Britishmotte.
