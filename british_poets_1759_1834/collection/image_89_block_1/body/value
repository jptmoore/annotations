"occasion offered, of presenting to you the best poem of the best poet. If I balked this opportu- nity, T was in despair of finding such another; and, if T took it, I was still uncertain whether youn would vouchsafe to accept it from my hands. It was a bold venture which I made, in desiring your permission to lay niy unworthy labours at your feet. But my rashness has succeeded heyond my hopes ; and you have been pleased not to suffer an old man to go discontented out of the world, for want of that protection, of which he had been so long ambitious. I have kmown a gentleman in disgrace, and not daring to appear before king Charles the Second, though he much desired it : at length he took the confidence to attend a fair lady to the court, and told his majesty, that, under her protec- tion, he had presumed to wait on him. With the same humble confidence, I present myself before your lordship : and, attending on Virgil, hope a gracions reception. The gentleman succeeded, because the powerful lady was his friend ; but I have too much injured my great author, to expect Lie should intercede for me. I would have trans- lated him ; but, according to the literal French and Italian phrases, I fear I have #raduced him. Tt is the fault of many a well-meaning man, to be offi- cious in a wrong place, and do a prejudice where he had endeavoured to do a service. Virgil wrote his Georgics in the full strength and vigour of his age, when his judgment was at the height, and before his fancy was declining. He had (according to our homely saying) his full swing at this poem ; beginning it about the age of thirty-five, and scarce concluding it before he arrived at forty."
