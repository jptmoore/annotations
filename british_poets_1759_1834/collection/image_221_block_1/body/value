"furnishing himself also with observations from the practice of the theatre, when it flourished under ZEschylus, Euripides, and Sophocles : for the ori- ginal of the stage was from the epic poem. Nar- ration, doubtless, preceded acting and gave laws to it: what at first was told artfully, was, in pro- cess of time, represented gracefully to the sight and hearing. Those episodes of Homer, which were proper for thestage, the poets amplified each into an action: out of his limbs they formed their bodies : what he had contracted, they enlarged : out of one Hercules, were made infinity of pig- mies, yet all endued with human souls : for from him, their great creator, they have each of them the divine particulam aure. They flowed from him at first, and are at last resolved into him. Nor were they only animated by him, but their measure and symmetry was owing to him, Hisone, entire, and great action, was copied by them ac- cording to the proportions of the drama. If he finished his orb within the year, it sufficed to teach them, that, their action being less, and being also less diversified with incidents, their orb, of conse- quence, must be circumscribed in a less compass, which they reduced within the limits either of a na- tural oran artificial day : so that, as he taught them to amplify what he had shortenedâ€”by the same rule, applied the contrary way, he taught them to shorten what he had amplified. Tragedy is the miniature of human life ; and epic poem is the draught at length."
