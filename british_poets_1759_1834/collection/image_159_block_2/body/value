"1, first of Romans, shall in triumph come From conquer'd Greece,and bring her trophieshome, With foreign spoils adorn my native place, And with Idume’s palms my HMantua grace. Of Parian stone a temple will I raise, Where the slow Mincius through the valley strays, Where cooling streams invite the flocks to drink, And reeds defend the winding water’s brink. Full in the midst shall mighty Ceasar stand, Hold the chief honours, and the dome command. Then I, conspicuous in my Tyrian gown (Submitting to his godhead my renown), A hundred coursers from the goal will drive : \"The rival chariots in the race shall strive. All Greece shall flock from far, my games to see ; The whorlbat, and the rapid race, shall be % Reserv'd for Casar, and ordain'd by me. Myself, with olive crown'd, the gifts will bear. l Een now methinks the public shouts T hear; The passing pageants and the pomps appear. s I to the temple will conduct the crew, The sacrifice and sacrificers view. From thence return, attended with my train, Where the proud theatres disclose the scene, Which interwoven Britons seem to raise, And show the triumph which their shame displays. High o’er the gate, in elephant and gold, The crowd shall Ceesar's Indian war behold : The Nile shall flow beneath ; and, on the side, His shatter’d ships on brazen pillars ride,"
