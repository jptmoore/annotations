"Zneas relates how the city of Troy was taken, after a ten years’ siege, by the treachery of Sinon, and the stratagem of a wooden horse, e declares the fixed resolution he had taken not to survive the inin of his country, and the varions ad- ventores he met with in defence of it. At last having been before advised by Hector’s ghost, and now by the appearance of his mother Venus, he is prevailed upon to leave the town, and settle his honsehold gods in another conntry. 1In order to this, be carries off his father on his shoulders, and leads his little son by the hand, his wife following bim behind. When he comes to the place appointed for the general ren- dezvous, he finds a great confluence of people, but misses his wite, whose ghost afterwards appears to him, and tells him the land which was designed for him."
