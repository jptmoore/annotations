"And, now their navy ploughs the watery main, Yet, soon expect it on your shores again, } With Pallas pleas'd; as Calchas did ordain. But first, to reconcile the blue-eyed maid For her stol'n statue and her tower betrayed, Warn'd by the seer, to her offended name We rais’'d and dedicate this wondrous frame, So lofty, lest through your forbidden gates It pass, and intercept our better fates: For, once admitted there, our hopes are lost ; And Troy may then a new Palladium boast : For so religion and the gods ordain, That, if you violate with hands profane Minerva's gift, your town in flames shall burn; (Which omen, O ye gods, on Grecia turn!) But if it climb, with your assisting hands, The 'Trojan walls, and in the city stands ; Then Troy shall Argos and Mycenz burn, And the reverse of fate on us return.’"
