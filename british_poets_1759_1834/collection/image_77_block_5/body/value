"¢ See, while my last endeavours I delay, The waking ashes rise, and round our altars play ! Run to the threshold, Amaryllis—hark ! Our Hylax opens, and begins to hark. Good heaven! may lovers what they wish believe ? Or dream their wishes, and those dreams deceive ? Nomore! my Daphnis comes! nomore, my charms! He comes, he runs, he leaps, to my desiring arms.’"
