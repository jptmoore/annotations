"We landed at the port, and soon beheld Fat herds of oxen graze the flowery field : And wanton goats without a keeper stray’d.— With weapons we the welcome prey invade, \"Then call the gods for partners of our feast, And Jove himself, the chief invited guest. ‘We spread the tables on the greensward ground: We feed with hunger ; and the bowis go round ; ‘When from the mountain-tops, with hideous cry, And clattering wings, the hungry Harpies fly : They snatch the meat, defiling all they find, And, parting, leave a loathsome stench hehind. Close by a hollow rock, again we sit, New dress the dinner, and the beds refit, Secure from sight, beneath a pleasing shade, ‘Where tufted trees a native arbour made, Again the holy fires on altars burn ; Aud once again the rayenous birds return, Or from the dark recesses where they lie, Or from another quarter of the sky— With filthy claws their odious meal repeat, And mix their loathsome ordures with their ' meat, T bid my friends for vengeance then prepare, And with the hellish nation wage the war,"
