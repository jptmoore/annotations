"Some peasants, not to omit the nicest care, Of the same soil their nursery prepare, With that of their plantation; lest the tree, Translated, should not with the soil agree. Beside, to plant it as it was, they mark The heaven's four quarters on the tender bark, And to the north or south restore the side, â€˜Which at their birth did heat or cold abide : So strong is custom ; such effects can use In tender souls of pliant plants produce."
