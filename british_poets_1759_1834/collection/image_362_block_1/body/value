"After so many funerals of thy own, Art thou restor’d to thy declining town? But say, what wounds are these? what new disgrace Deforms the manly features of thy face ? To this the spectre no reply did frame, But answer'd to the cause for which he came, And, groaning from the bottom of his breast, This warning, in these mournful words, express'd : ¢ O goddess-born! escape, by timely flight, The flames and horrors of this fatal night. The foes already have possess'd the wall : Troy nods from high, and totters to her fall. Enough is paid to Priam’s royal name, More than enough to duty and to famne, If by a mortai hand my father’s throne Could be defended, ‘twas by mine alone. Now Troy to thee commends her future state, And gives her gods companions of thy fate : From their assistance, happier walls expect, ‘Which, wandering long, at last thou shalt erect.’ He said, and brought me, from their bless’d abodes, The venerable statues of the gods, ‘With ancient Vesta from the sacred choir, The wreaths and relics of the’ immortal fire. Now peals of shouts come thundering from afar, Cries, threats, and loud laments, and mingled war: The noise approaches, though our palace stood Aloof from streets, encompass’d with a wood. Louder, and yet more loud, I hear the’ alarms Of human cries distinct, and clashing arms. Fear broke my slumbers; T no longer stay, But mount the terrace, thence the town survey, And earken what the frightful sounds convey. §"
