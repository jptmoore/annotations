"and therefore, as he himself professes, are sermoni propiora, nearer prose than verse. But Virgil, who never attempted the lyric verse, is every wliere ele- gant, sweet, and flowing in his hexameters. His words are not only chosen, but the places in which he ranks them for the sound. He who removes them from the station wherein their master set them, spoils the harmony. What he says of the Sibyl's prophecies, may he as preperly applied to every word of his ; they must be read in erder as they lie ; the least breath discomposes them, and somewhat of their divirity is lost. I cannot hoast that I have been thus exactin my verses; but I have endeavoured to follow the example of my master, and am the first Englishman, perhaps, who made it his design to copy him in his numbers, his choice of words, and his placing them for the sweet- ness of the sound. On this last consideration, I- bave shunned the cesura as much as possibly I could : for, wherever that is nsed, it gives a rough- ness to the verse; of which we can have little need in a language which is everstocked with consonants."
