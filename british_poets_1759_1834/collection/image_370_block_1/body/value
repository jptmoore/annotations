"Before the gate stood Pyrrhus, threatening loud, With glittering arms conspicuous in the crowd. So shines, renew’d in youth, the crested snake, Who slept the winter in a thorny brake. And, casting off’ his slough when spring returns, Now looks aloft, and with new glory burns, Restor'd with poisonous herbs : his ardent sides Reflect the sun; and, rais'd on spires, he rides High o'er the grass: hissing he rolls along, And brandishes Ly fits his forky tongue. Proud Periphas, and fierce Automedon, His father’s charioteer, together run To force, the gate : the Scyrian infantry Rush on in crowds, and the barr’d passage free. Entering the court, with shouts the skies they rend; And flaming firebrands to the roofs ascend. Himself, among the foremost, deals his blows, And with his axe repeated strokes bestows On the strong doors: then all their shoulders ply, Till from the posts the brazen hinges fly. He hews apace : the double bars at length Yield to Lis axe, and unresisted strength. A mighty breach is made: the rooms conceal’d Appear, and all the palace is reveald— The halls of audience, and of public state, And where the lonely queen in secret sate. Arm’d soldiers now by trembling maids are seen, With not a door, and scarce a space, between. The house is fill'd with loud laments and cries; And shrieks of women rend the vaulted skies. The fearful matrons run from place to place, And kiss the thresholds, and the posts embrace. Tee fatal work inhuman Pyrrhus plies; And all bis father sparkles in Lis eyes."
