"But old Anchises, vers'd in omens, rear’d His hands to heaven, and this request preferr'd : ¢ If any vows, almighty Jove, can bend Thy will—if piety can prayers commend— Confirm the glad presage which thou art pleas'd to send.’ Scarce had he said, when, on our left, we hear A peal of rattling thunder roll in air : There shot a streaming, lamp along the sky, Which on the winged lightning seemd to fly : From o’er the roof the blaze began to move, And, trailing, vanish’d in the’ Idean grove. It swept a path in heaven, and shone a guide, \"Then in a steaming stench of sulphur died. The good old man with suppliant hands implor’d The gods’ protection, and their star ador’d. ¢ Now, now, (said he) my son, no more delay! I yield, I follow where heav'n shows the way. Keep, O my country gods! our dwelling-place, And guard this relic of the Trojan race, This tender child '—These omens are your own ; And you can yet restore the ruin’d town. At least accomplish what your signs foreshow : I stand resign’d, and am prepar'd to go.' He said.—The crackling flames appear on high ; And driving sparkles dance along the sky. ‘With Vulcan's rage the rising winds conspire, And near our palace roll the flood of fire. ¢ Haste, my dear father! ’tis no time to wait, And load my shoulders with a willing freight. Whate'er befals, your life shall be my care ; One death, or one deliverance, we will share, My hand shall lead our little son ; and you, My faithful consort, shall our steps pursue."
