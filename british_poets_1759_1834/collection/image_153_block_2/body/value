"O happy, if he knew his happy state, The swain, who, free from business and debate, Receives his easy food from Nature’s hand, And just returns of cultivated land ! No palace, with a lofty gate, he wants, To admit the tides of early visitants, With eager eyes devouring, as they pass, The breathing figures of Corinthian brass. No statues threaten, from high pedestals ; No Persian arras hides his homely walls, With antic vests, which, through their shady fold, Betray the streaks of ill-dissembled gold : He hoasts no wool, whose native white is dy’d With purple poison of Assyrian pride : No costly drugs of Araby defile, With foreign scents, the sweetness of his oil ; But easy quict, a secure retreat, A harmless life that knows not how to cheat, With home-hred plenty, the rich owner bless ; And rural pleasures crown his happiness. Unvex'd with quarrels, undistarb’d with noise, The country king his peaceful realm enjoys— Cool grots, and living lakes, the flowery pride Of meads, and streams that through the valley glide, And shady groves that easy sleep invite, And, after toilsome days, a soft repose at night. Wild beasts of nature in his woods abound ; And youth, of labour patient, plough the ground, Inwr'd to hardship, and to homely fare, Nor venerabie age is wanting there, In great examples to the youthful train ; Nor are the gods ador'd with rites profane."
