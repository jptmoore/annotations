"what is meant by those many figurative expres- sions i’ bat, if he had consulted the younger Vos- sius’s dissertation on this Pastoral, or read the ex- cellent oration of the emperor Constantine, (made French by a good pen of their own,) he would have found there the plain interpretation of all those figurative expressions; and, withal, very strong proofs of the traths of the Christian re- ligion : such as converted heathens ; as Valerianus, and others. And upon account of this piece, the most learned of all the Latin fathers calis Virgil a Christian, even before Christianity. Cicero takes notice of it in kLis books of Divination; and Virgil probably had put it in verse a considerable time before the edition of his Pastorals. Nor does he appropriate it to Pollio, or his son, but compli- mentally dates it from his consulship ; and, there- fore, some one who had not so kind theughts of M. Fontenelle as I, would be inclined to think him as bad a catholic as critic in this place."
