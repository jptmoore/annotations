"¢ O Nisa! justly to thy choice condemn’d! Whom hast thou taken, whom hast thou contemn'd ¢ For him, thou hast refus'd my browzing herd, Scern'd my thick eye-brows and my shaggy beard. Unhappy Damon sighs and sings in vain, While Nisa thinks no god regmds a lover's pain, Begin with me, my flute, the sweet Manalian strain, ¢ I view'd thee first (how fatal was the view!), And led thee where the ruddy wildings grew, High on the planted hedge, and wet withmorning dew. Then scarce the bending branches I could win; The callow down began to clothe my chin. Isaw ; I perish'd ; yet indulg'd my pain. Begin with me, my flute, the sweet Manalian stram. ‘I know thee, Love! in deserts thon wert bre And at the dugs of savage tigers fed ; Alien of birth, usurper of the plains! Begin withme, my flute, the sweet Mzenalianstrains. ¢ Relentless Love the cruel mother led The blood of her unhappy babes to shed : Love lent the sword ; the inother struck the blow; Inhuman she ; but more inhuman thou : Alien of birth, nsurper of the plains ! Begin with me, my fiute, the sweet Manalianstrains. ¢ Old doting Nature, change thy course anew ; And let the trembling lamb the wolf pursue : Let oaks now glitter with Hesperian fiait, And parple daffodils from alder shoot ; Fat amber let the tamarisk distil, And hooting owls contend with swans in skill ; Hoarse Tityrus strive with Orpliens in the woods, And challenge fam’d Arion on the floods."
