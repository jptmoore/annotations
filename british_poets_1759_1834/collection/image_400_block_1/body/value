"Nor let the threaten'd famine fright thy mind : For Pheebus will assist ; and Fate the way will find. Let not thy course to that ill coast be bent, Which fronts from far the’ Epirian continent : Those parts are all by Grecian foes possess'd. The savage Locrians here the shores infest : There fierce Idomeneus his cify builds, And guards with arms the Salentinian fields ; And on the mountain’s brow Petilia stands, Which Philoctetes with his troops commands. E'en when thy fleet is landed on the shore, And priests with holy vows the gods adore, Then with a purple veil invelve your eyes, Lest hostile faces blast the sacrifice. These rites and customs to the rest commend, That to your pious race they may descend. When, parted hence, the wind that ready waits For Sicily, shall bear you to the straits ‘Where proud Pelorus opes a wider way, Tack to the larboard, and stand off to sea: Veer starboard sea and land. The’ Ttalian shore, And fair Sicilia’s eoast, were one, before An earthquake caus'd the flaw : the roaring tides The passage broke, that land from land divides; And, where the lands retir'd, the rushing ocean rides."
