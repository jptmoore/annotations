"What I have said, though it has the face of arro- gance, yet is intended for the honour of my coun- try ; and therefore I will boldly own, that this Eng- lish translation has more of Virgilâ€™s spirit in it, than either the French or the Italian. Some of our coun- trymen have translated cpisodes, and other parts of Virgil, with great success ; as particularly your lordship, whose version of Orpheus and Eurydice is eminently good. Amongst the dead authors, the Silenus of my Lord Roscommon cannot be too much commended. I say nothing of Sir John Denham, Mr, Waller, and Mr. Cowley: it is the utmost of my ambition to be thought their equal, or not te be much inferior to them, and some others of the living. But it is one thing to take pains on a frag- ment, and translate it perfectly; and another thing to have the weight of a whole author on my shoul- ders. They who believe the burden light, let them attempt the fourth, sixth, or eighth Pastoral ; the first or fourth Georgic ; and amongst the /Eneids, the fourth, the fifth, the seventh, the ninth, the tenth, the eleventh, or the twelfth: for in these I think I have succeeded best."
