"In youth alone, unhappy mortals live ; But, ah! the mighty bliss is fugitive : Discolour'd sickness, anxious labour, come, And age, and death’s inexorable doom. Yearly thy herds in vigour will impair, Recruit and mend them with thy yearly care : Still propagate ; for still they fail away : \"Tis prudence to prevent the’ entire decay. Like diligence requires the courser’s race, In early choice, and for a longer space. \"The colt, that for a stallion is design'd, By sure presages shows his generous kind : Of able body, sound of limb and wind, Upright he walks, on pasterns firm and straight; His motions easy ; prancing in his gait; The first to lead the way, to tempt the flood, To pass the bridge unknown, nor fear the trem- bling wood : Dauntless at empty noises ; lofty neck’d: Sharp-headed, barrel-bellied, broadly back’d; Brawny his chest, and deep ; his colour grey ; For beauty, dappled ; or the briglitest bay : Faint white and dun will scarce the rearing pay.} The fiery courser, when he hears from far The sprightly trumpets, and the shouts of war, Pricks up his ears ; and trembling with delight, Shifts place, and paws, and hopes the promis'd fight. On his right shoulder his thick mane reclin'd, Rufiles at speed, and dances in the wind. His horny hoofs are jetty black, and round ; 1 His chine is double ; starting with a bound He turns the turf, and shakes the solid ground. Fire from his eyes, clouds from his nostrils flow; He bears his rider headlong on the fee. VOL. I, L"
