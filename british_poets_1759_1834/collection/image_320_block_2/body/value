"To this the god :—¢ *Tis yours, O queen! to will The work, which duty binds me to fulfil. These airy kingdoms, and this wide command, Are all the presents of your bounteous hand : Yours is my sovereign’s grace ; and, as your guest, 1 sit with gods at their celestial feast. Raise tempests at your pleasure, or subdue; Dispose of empire, which I hold from you.’"
