"Starves and destroys the fruit, is only made For brawny bulk, and for a barren shade. The plant that shoots from seed, a sullen tree, At leisure grows, for late posterity ; The generous flavour lost, the fruits decay, And savage grapes are made the bird’s ignoble prey. Much labour is requir'd in trees, to tame Their wild disorder, and in ranks reclaim. Well must the ground be digg’d, and better dress'd, New soil to make, and meliorate the rest. Old stakes of olive-trees in plants revive; By the same method Paphian myrtles Jive: % But nobler vines by propagation thrive. From roots hard hazels, and from cions rise ; \"Tall ash, and taller oak that mates the skies ; Palm, poplar, fir, descending from the steep Of hills, to try the dangers of the deep, The thin-leav'd arbute hazel-graffs receives; And planes huge apples bear, that bore but leaves. Thus mastful beech the bristly chesnut bears, And the wild ash is white with blooming pears, And greedy swine from grafted elms are fed With falling acorns, that on oaks are bred."
