"Cheerly their tedious travels undergo, .And pitch their sudden camp before the foe, Not so the Scythian shepherd tends his fold, Nor he who bears in Thrace the bitter cold, Nor he who treads the bleak Mzotian strand, Or where proud Ister rolls his yellow sand, Early they stall their flocks and herds ; for there No grass the fields, no leaves the forests, wear : The frozen earth lies buried there, below A hilly heap, seven cubits deep in snow ; } And all the west allies of stormy Boreas blow.

From locks uncomb'd, and from the frozen beard, Long icicles depend,and crackling soundsare heard, Meantime, perpetual sleet and driving snow Obscure the skies, and hang on herds below. The starving cattle perish in their stalls ; Huge oxen stand inclos'd in wintery walls Of snow congeal'd ; whole herds are buried there Of mighty stags, and scarce their horns appear.
