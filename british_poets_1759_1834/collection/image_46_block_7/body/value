"Love has no bounds in pleasure, or in pain. What frenzy, shepherd, has thy soul possess'd ? Thy vineyard lies half prun'd, and half undress'd. Quench, Corydon, thy long unanswer'd fire! Mind what the common wants of life require ; On willow twigs employ thy weaving care ; And find an easier love, thongh not so fair."
