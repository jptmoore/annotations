"As hungry wolves, with raging appetite, Scour through the fields, nor fear thestormy night— Their whelps at home expect the promis'd food, And long to temper their dry chaps in blood— So rush’d we forth at once. Re olvd to die, Resolv'd, in death, the last extremes to try, We leave the narrow lanes behind, and dare The’ unequal combat in the public square : Night was our friend ; our leader was Despair. ‘What tongue can tell the slaughter of that night? What eyes can weep the sorrows and affright? An ancient and imperial city falls; The streets are fil’d with frequent funerals : Houses and holy temples float in blood ; And hostile nations make a common flood. Not only Trojans fall ; but, in their turn, The vanquish'd triumph, and the victors mourn. Ours take new courage from despair and night ; Confus'd the fortune is, confus’d the fight. All parts resound with tumults, plaints, and fears ; And grisly Death in sundry shapes appears. Androgeos fell among us, with his band, Who thought us Grecians newly come to land. ¢ Fromwhence, (said he) my friends, thislong delay? You loiter, while the spoils are borne away : Our ships are laden with the Trojan store ; And you, like truants, come too late ashore."
