"No room is left for death: they mount the sky, And to their own congenial planets fly. Now, when thouhast decreed to seize their stores, And, by prerogative, to break their doors ; With sprinkled water first the city choke, And then pursue the citizens with smoke. Two honey-harvests fall in every year: First when the pleasing Pleiades appear, And, springing upward, spurn the briny seas : Again, when their affrighted choir surveys The watery Scorpion mend his pace behind, With a black train of storms, and winter wind, They plunge into the deep, and safe protection find. Prone to revenge, the bees, a wrathful race, When once provok’d, assault the’ aggressor’s face, And through the purple veins a passage find; There fix their stings, and leave their souls behind. But, if a pinching winter thou foresee, And would'st preserve thy famislh’d family ; With fragrant thyme the city fumigate, And break the waxen walls to save the state. For lurking lizards often lodge, by stealth, Within the suburbs, and purlein their wealth ; And worms that shun the light, a dark retreat Have found in combs, and undermin'd the seat; Or lazy drones, without their share of pain, In winter-quarters free, devour the gain; Or wasps infest the camp with loud alarms, And mix in battle with unequal arms ; Or secret moths are there in silence fed ; Or spiders in the vault their snary webs have spread. The more oppress'd by foes, or famine-pin'd, The more increase thy care to save the sinkingkind :"
