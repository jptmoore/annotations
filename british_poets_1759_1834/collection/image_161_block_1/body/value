"High Epidanrus urges on my speed, Fam'd for his hills, and for his horses’ breed : From hills and dales the cheerful cries rehound ; For Echo hunts along, and propagates the sound. A time will come, when my maturer Muse, - In Cwsar's wars, a nobler theme shall choose, And through more ages bear my sovereign's praise, Than have from Tithon pass'd to Casar’s days. The generous youth, who, studious of the prize, The race of running coursers multiplies, Or to the plough the sturdy bullock breeds, May know that from the dam the worth of each proceeds. The mother-cow must wear a louring look, Sour-headed, strongly neck’d, to bear the yoke. Her double dewlap firom her chin descends, And at her thighs the ponderous burden ends. Long are her sides, and large ; her limbs are great; Rough are her ears, and broad her horny feet. Her colour shining black, but fleck’d with white ; She tosses from the yoke ; provokes the fight : She rises in her gait, is free from fears, And in her face a bull's resemblance bears : Her ample forehead with a star is crown'd ; And with her length of tail she sweeps the ground. \"The bull’'s insult at four she may sustain ; But, after ten from nuptial rites refrain. Six seasons use ; but then release the cow, Uxfit for love, and for the labouring plough. Now, while their youth is fill'd with Kindly fire, Submit thy females to the Insty sire : Watch the quick motions of the frisking tail ; l \"Then serve their fury with the rushing male, Indulging pleasure lest the breed should fail.
