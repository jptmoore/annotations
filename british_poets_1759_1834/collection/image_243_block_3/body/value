"Augustus, it is true, had once resolved to rebuild that city, and there to make the seat of empire: but Horace writes an ode Â® on purpose to deter him from that thought; declaring the place to be ac- cursed, and that the gods would as often destroy it, as it should be raised. Hereupon, the emperor laid aside a project so ungrateful to the Roman people, But by this, my lord, we may conclude that he had still his pedigree in his head, and had an itch of being thought a divine king, if his poets had not given him better counsel."
