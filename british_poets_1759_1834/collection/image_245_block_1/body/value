"are as much better critics than the English, as they are worse poets. Thus we generally allow that they better understand the management of a war, than our islanders ; but we know we are superior to them in the day of battle. They value them- selves on their generals, we on our soldiers. But this isnot the proper place to decide that question, if they make it one. I shall perhaps say as much of other nations, and their poets, excepting only Tasso ; and hope to make my assertion good, which is but doing justice to my country; part of which honour will reflect on your lordship, whose thoughts are always just, your numbers harmonious, your words chosen, your expressions strong and manly, your verse flowing, and your turns as happy as they are easy. If you would set us more copies, your example would make all precepts needless. In the mean time, that little you have written is owned, and that particularly by the poets (who are a nation not over-lavish of praise to their contemporaries), as a principal ornament of our language : but the sweetest essences are always confined in the smallest glasses. ;"
