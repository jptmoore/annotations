"not have been induced hy any motive to put this part of Virgil, or any other, into unlearned hands. You have read him with pleasure, and, I dare say, with adiration, in the Latin, of which you are a master., You have added to your natural endow- ments, (which without flattery are eminent,) the superstructures of study, and the knowiedge of good anthors. Courage, probity, and humanity, are inherentin you. These virtues have ever been habitual to the ancient house of Cumberiand, from whence you are descended, and of which our chro- nicles make so honourable mention in the long wars betwixt the rival families of York and Lancaster. Your forefathers have asserted the party which they chose, till death, and died for its defence in the fields of battle. You have, besides, the fresh remembrance of your noble father, from whom you never can degenerate."
