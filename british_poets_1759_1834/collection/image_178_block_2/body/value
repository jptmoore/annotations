"In fair Calabria’s woods a snake is bred, With curling crest, and with advancing head ; ‘Waving he rolls, and makes a winding track ; His belly spotted, burnish’'d is his back. ‘While springs are broken, while the southern air And dropping heavens the moisten'd earth repair, He lives on standing lakes and trembling bogs, And fills his maw with fish, or with loquacious frogs ; But when, in muddy pools, the water sinks, And the chapt earth is furrow’d o’er with chinks, He leaves the fens, and leaps upon the ground, And, hissing, rolls his glaring eyes around. With thirst inflam'd, impatient of the heats, He rages in the fields, and wide destruction threats. Oh! let not sleep my closing eyes intvade In open plains, or in the secret shade, ‘When he, renew’d in all the speckied pride Of pompons youth, has cast his slongh aside, 'And in his summer livery rolls along, Erect, and brandishing his forky tongue, Leaving his nest, and his imperfect young, And, thonghtless of his eggs, forgets to rear The hopes of poison for the following year."
