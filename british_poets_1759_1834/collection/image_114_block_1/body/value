"But, ere we stir the yet-unbroken ground, The various course of seasons must be found ; The weather, and the setting of the winds, The culture suiting to the several kinds Of seeds and plants, and what will thrive and rise, And what the genius of the soil denies. This ground with Bacchus, that with Ceres, suits: ‘That other loads the trees with happy fruits : A fourth, with grass unbidden decks the ground. Thus Tmolus is with yellow saffron crown'd : India black ebon and white ivory bears; And soft Idume weeps her odorous tears. Thus Pontus sends her beaver-stones from far; And naked Spaniards temper steel for war; Epirus, for the’ Elean chariot, breeds {In hopes of palms) a race of running steeds. \"This is the’ original contract; these the laws Impos'd by Nature, and by Nature’s cause, On sundry places, when Dencalion hurl’d His mother’s entrails on the desert world ; ‘Whence men, a hard laborious kind, were born. Then borrow part of winter for thy corn; } And early,with thy team,the glebeinfurrows turn; That while the turf lies open and unbound, Succeeding suns may bake the mellow ground. But if the soil be barren, only scar The surface, and but lightly print the share, ‘When cold Arctuarus rises with the sun ; Lest wicked weeds the corn should overrun In watery soils ; or lest the barren sand Shonld suck the moisture from the thirsty land. Both these unhappy soils the swain forbears, And keeps a sabbath of alternate years, That the spent earth may gather heart again, And, better'd by cessation, bear the grain."
