"Then had our lances pierc’d the treacherous wood, And Ilian tow'rs and Priam’s empire stood. Meantime, with shouts, the Trojan shepherds bring A captive Greek in bands, before the king— Taken, to take—who made himself their prey, To’ impose on their belief, and Troy betray ; Fix'd on his aim, and obstinately bent To die undaunted, or to circamvent. About the captive, tides of Trojans flow ; All press to see, and some insult the foe. Now hear how well the Greeks their wiles disgnis'd : Behold a nation in a man compris'd. Trembling the miscreant stood : nharm’dand bound, He star’d, and roll'd his haggard eyes around ; Then said, ¢ Alas! what earth remains, what sea Is open to receive unhappy me? What fate a wretched fugitive attends, Scorn’d by my foes, abandon’d by my friends !’ He said, and sigh'd, and cast a rueful eye : Our pity kindies, and our passions die. We cheer the youth to make his own defence, And freely tell us what he was, and whence : What news he could impart we long to know, And what to credit from a captive foe."
