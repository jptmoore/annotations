"French have set up purity for the standard of their language ; and a masculine vigour is that of ours. Like their tongue, is the genius of their poets, licht and trifling in comparison of the English; more proper for sonnets, madrigals, and elegies, than heroic poetry. The turn on thoughts and words is their chief talent ; but the epic poem is too stately to receive those little ornaments. The painters draw their nymphs in thin and airy habits: but the weight of gold and of embroideries is reserved for queens and goddesses. Virgil is never frequent‚Äù in those turns, like Ovid ; but much more sparing ot them in his /Eneis, than in his Pastorals and Georgics : Ignoscenda quidem, scirent si ignoscere manes."
