"The commentators can by no means agree on the person of Alexis, but are all of opinion that some beautifal youth is meant by him, to whom Virgil here makes love, in Cory- dow’s language and simplicity. His way of courtship is wholly pastoral : he complains of the boy’s coyness; re- commends himself for his beauty and skill in piping; in- vites the youth into the country, where he promises him the diversions of the place, with a suitable present of nuts and apples. But when he finds nothing will prevail, he resolves 10 quit his troublesome amour, and betake himself agzin to his former business."
