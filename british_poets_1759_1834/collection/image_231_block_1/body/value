"judge with one advantage of the former over the latter, which I now casually remember out of the preface of Ségrais before his translation of the Zueis, or out of Bossu, no matter which: ¢ the style of the heroic poem is, and cught to be, more lofty than that of the drama’ The critic is cer- tainly in the right, for the reason already urged : the work of tragedy is on the passions, and in a dialogue : both of them abhor strong metaphors, in which the epopee delights. A poet cannot speak too plainly on the stage : for volat irrevoca- bile verbum ; the sense is lost, if it be not taken flying. But what we read alone, we have leisure to digest: there an author may beautify his sense by the boldness of Lis expression, which if we un- derstand not fally at the first, we may dwell upon it till we find the secret force and excellence. That which cures the manners by alterative physic, as I said before, must proceed by insensible de- grees ; but that which purges the passions, must do its business all at once, or wholly fail of its effect ; at least, in the present operation, and with- out repeated doses. We must beat the iron while itis hot; but we may polish it at leisure. Thus, my lord, you pay the fine of my forgetfulness ; and yet the merits of both causes are where they were, and undecided, till you declare whether it be more for the benefit of mankind to have their manners in general corrected, or their pride and hardheart- edness removed."
