"DAMETAS. Good words, young catamite, at least to men. We know who did your business, how and when ; And in what chapel too you play’d your prize, And what the goats observ'd with leering eyes :— The nymphs were kind, and laugh'd ; and there vour safety lies. MENALCAS. Yes, when I cropt the hedges of the leys, Cut Micon's tender vines, and stole the stays! DAM@TAS. Or rather, when, beneath yon ancient oak, The bow of Daphmnis, and the shafts, you broke, ‘When the fair boy receiv'd the gift of right ; And, but for mischief, you had died for spite. MENALCAS. ‘What nonsense would the fool thy master prate, When thon, his knave, canst talk at such a rate! Did I not see you, rascal, did T not, ‘When you lay snug to snap young Damon’s goat? His mongrel bark’d ; I ran to Lis relief,  [thief!’ And cried,—*¢ There, there he goes! stop, stop the Discover'd, and defeated of your prey, You skulk’d behind the fence, and sneak'd away. 3 DAMCETAS. An honest man may freely take his own : The goat was mine, by singing fairly won. A solemn match was made ; he lost the prize. Ask Damon, ask if he the debt denies. % I think Le dares not; if he does, he lies. MENALCAS. Thon sing with him? thou booby!—Never pipe Was so profan'd to touch that biubber'd lip. Dunce at the best! in streets but scarce allow'd To tickle, on thy straw, the stupid crowd."
