"Such is not the Latin, where the vowels and con- sonants are mixed in proportion to each other: yet Virgil judged the vowels to have somewhat of an over-balance, and therefore tempers their sweetness with cesuras. Such difference there is in tongues, that the same figure, which roughens one, gives ma- Jesty to another : and that was it which Virgil stu- died in his verses. Ovid uses it but ravely; and hence it is that his versification cannot so properly be calledsweet, as luscious. The Italians are foreed upon it once or twice in every line, because they Lave a redundancy of vowels in their language. Their metal is so soft, that it will not coin without alloy to harden it. On the other side (for the rea- son already named), it is all we can do to give suf- ficient sweetness to our language: we must not only choose our words for elegance, but for sound ; to perform which, a mastery in the Janguage is requir- ed ; the poet must have a magazine of words, and have the art to manage his few vowels to the best advantage, that they may go the further. He must also know the nature of the vowels—which are more sonorous, and which more soft and sweet— and so dispose them as his present occasions re- quire : all which, and a thousand secrets of versifi- cation beside, he may learn from Virgil, if he wiil take him for his guide. Ifhe be above Virgil, and is resolved to follow his own verve (as the French call it,) the proverb will fall heavily upon him: ¢ Who teaches himself, has a fool for his master.’ Virgil employed eleven years upon his /Eneis: yet he left it, as he thought himself, imperfeet; which when T seriously consider, I wish that, in- stead of three years which T have spentin the trans-"
