"Nec deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice nodus— that rule is to be applied to the theatre, of which he is then speaking, and means no more than this ; that when the knot of the play is to be untied, and no other way is left for making the discovery—then, and noet otherwise, let a god descend upon a rope, and clear the business to the audience; but this has no relation to the machines which are used in an epic poem."
