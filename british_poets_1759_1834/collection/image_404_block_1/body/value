"Leaves you no further wish. My different state, Avoiding one, incurs another fate. To you a quiet seat the gods allow : You have no shores to search, no seas to plough, Nor fields of flying Italy to chase— Deluding visions, and a vain embrace ! You see another Simois, and enjoy The labour of your hands, another Troy, With better auspice than her ancient towers, And less obnoxious to the Grecian powers. If e'er the gods, whom I with vows adore, Conduct my steps to Tyber’s happy shore— If ever T ascend the Latian throne, And build a city I may call my own— As hoth of us our birth from Troy derive, So let our kindred lines in concord live, % And both in acts of equal friendship strive, Our fortunes, good or bad, shall be the same : The double Troy shall differ but in name ; That what we now begin may never end, But long to late posterity descend.’"
