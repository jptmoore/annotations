"- T know it may be answered, by such as think Virgil the author of the four lines, that he asserts his title to the Eneis in the beginning of this work, as he did to the two former in the last lines of the fourth Georgic. I will not reply otherwise to this, than by desiring them to compare these four lines with the four others, which we know are his, be- cause no poet but he alone could write them. If they cannot distinguish creeping from flying, let them lay down Virgil, and take up Ovid, de Ponto, in his stead. DMy master needed not the assistance of that preliminary poet to prove his claim. His own majestic mien discovers him to be the king, amidst a thousand courtiers. It was a superfiious office ; and therefore I would not set those verses in the front of Virgil, but have rejected them to my own preface."
