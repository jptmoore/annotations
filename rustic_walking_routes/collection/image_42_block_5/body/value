"Route.â€”On quiiting Hanwell station, turn to the right, and at a short distance again to the right, through the railway arches. Then bear well to the left, and take the gravel path leading across a field to the church. At the left-hand corner of the churchyard pass through a white swing-gate, and take the field-path downhill to the Brent. Crossing the stream, keep to the right for a full mile to the Load of Hay tavern, Greenford. At the sign- post turn to the right over the bridge, and go a full mile till the road ends in one running right and left. Take the left-hand road (which soon bends to the right), and, avoiding a left-hand turning, go straight through the little village of Perivale, with its parish church on your right. A quarter of a mile beyond, enter a field-path on the left, over a stile beside a field-gate. Follow this path uatil it issues into a laue, where turn to the left, and almost im- mediately take a path on the right, entered by a common field-gate opposite a farm-house. Where this path ends at a road, turn leftward over the canal bridge; and then, avoiding the left-hand tumini near the bridge, as well as a right-hand one further on, keep the main road for fully half a mile to the Chequers tavern, Apperton."
