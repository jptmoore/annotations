"Before the construction of this reservoir, these upper waters of the Brent constituted from their junction a local river of respectable size, especially in rainy seasons; but now the whole of these waters are usually retained to replenish the reservoir, from which an arti- ficial channel takes a constant supply of water to feed the Regent’s Canal. Even when heavy floods occasionally cause an overflow of the reservoir at the waterfall (well worth seeing and hearing in action), the volume of the river i yet diminished by so much water as the canal-feeder can carry. This appropriation of the Brent’s upper waters impoverishes the river in its lower course, especially during dry seasons ; but, on the other hand, it prevents destructive winter inundations, and provides a fine lake for fishing, boating, or skating. Moreover, tho canals fed by such appropriations offer us some pleasant water scenery, as well as footways along their banks."
