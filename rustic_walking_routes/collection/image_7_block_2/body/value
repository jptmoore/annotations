"While the public have an indefeasible right with regard to foot-paths, they have also a duty to fulfil—namely, to respect the rights of private property. It might appear superfluous to admonish such ‘persons as are likely to buy and use this book against wanton trespass or mischief, like breaking fences, treading down crops, or worrying animals. Still, some Londoners may possibly require to be reminded that a field is not converted into a public park because it is skirted or traversed by a foot-path. It may be especially advisable to hint that growing hay-crops should be just as much respected as grain-crops. If farmers find it more profitable to grow hay than grain, it is obvious that quite as much harm may be done in trampling down the former as the latter. To avoid unnecessary injury to crops, the writer would counsel parties of ramblers to walk in single file on little-used paths, with only one worn track."
