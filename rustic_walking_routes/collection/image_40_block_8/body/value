"the Green Man. There, without passing the house, turn to the left a little way, till you reach ““ Piper’s Barn’’ on the right. From here follow the directions for Route 26, at least as far as the top of the ascent at Preston. There, however, variation may be made by passing the stile on the right, and following the road half a mile, till it turns sharply to the right, in front of a farm-house. Neither turn with the road nor towards the house, but go straight on over a field-gate admitting to a path. Take this path (diagonally rightward from the gate) under the Metro- politan and over the N.-W. Railway, and leftward through one ficld beyond the latter. Then, after crossing a small stream and a stile, take the rightward of two tracks, and follow it round the bathing-house of the Harrow boys, till you come out on a road. There cross to a stile a little to the left, and take a continuing path straight up into Harrow. Rerurn.—By Met. R.: 3 cl. to Baker Street, 84.; King’s Cross, 8}d."
