"they cultivate but very sparingly the root-crops which are grown as supplementary food for cattle even in most graz- ing districts. The fact is, that although the great bulk of the land is under grass, this district is not primarily and especially a grazing country. The hay-crop is rather the chief staple of the farmers, who find an ample and conve- nient market for their produce in London, with its many thousands of horses. Some of the meadows are kept in pasture throughout the year for horses, cows, or growing stock; but far less attention is given to dairy-farming or stock-raising than to hay-growing, since the local farmers have an advantage in producing close to a market a bulky article like hay, which advantage they do not possess to the same degree in regard to butter, milk, or even meat. The hay-meadows are in autumn and winter utilized in feeding cattle and sheep for the London market ; and some pasture is used for cow-keeping all the year, but rather for supplying milk to adjacent suburbs than to central London."
