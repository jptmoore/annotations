"Dollis Brook, the main affluent of the River Brent, rises about three-quarters of a mile north of Highwood Hill, and a little to the west of Arkley Lane. Under this lane the infant stream flows east- ward, following the course of the valley between the latitudinal elevations of High Barnet and Totteridge (T other-ridge), and then turns south-east to the longitudinal depression between Totteridge and Whetstone. In this depression the stream takes its way south- ward, receiving from the west a small tributary draining the valley between Totteridge and Mill Hill. Soon the brook turns south-west on approaching the high land of Finchley, and receives, at Parson’s Street, above Hendon, another small tributary, which drains the gouthern slope of Mill Hill. Proceeding now on a southern course, Dollis Brook makes at Decoy Farm a confluence with Mutton Brook, which drains the northern slope of Highgate. Thence the united stream flows westward under the more dignified name of the River Brent, and, after receiving two small tributaries from the northern slopes of Hampstead and Child’s Hill, falls into Hendqn Reservoir."
