"diately beyond this bridge, at a field-gate on the / left, take an almost disused and forgotten but still legitimate field-path. Passing straight through the small enclosure (used as a rick-yard) and over an B;’oncks&u;'z/ opposite gate, follow thence the bank of the stream till you come in sight of the railway embankment. There bear rightward to a double-X step-ladder stile within view ; and crossing the railway on the level, go straight on, passing over a ditch and a very rude stile into the next field. There you will find a plain path (crossing another), and will have only to follow it past the Harrow boys’ bathing-house, round which it bends leftward into aroad. Cross this a little leftward to a stile on the opposite side, and take a path across Harrow Park into the town. ReTURN.—By Met. R.: 3 cl. to Baker Street, 84.; K. Cross, 8}d."
