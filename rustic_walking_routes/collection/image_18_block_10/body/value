"traffic road, turn to the left for half a mile up the hill, to the centre of the hamlet of Colney Hatch. There, bearing leftward around the Orange-tree tavern, take the by-road to Whetstone and Barnet, and proceed half a mile to a white swing-gate on the right admitting to two field-paths. Take the left-hand path for fully half a mile; and when this emerges into a lane, turn to the left, till you come to a lane diverging to the right (to East Barnet). Turn down this lane for a quarter of a mile, until, opposite a farm-house, you see two stiles admitting to different field-paths. Take the further path, and follow it for half a mile to East Barnet church."
