"required on a grass-farm. The writer has been told of a large Middlesex farm which formerly provided work for fully a dozen labourers, but on which only three and a boy are now kept; has had barns pointed out to him in which a couple of men used to be thrashing all through winter, but in which there is now no corn to store or thrash; and has met persons who remembered hamlets like Preston with more than twice the number of houses they have now. Hence the really rural parts of our district are at this time more solitary and secluded than they were generations ago. There are by-ways and foot-paths, once in pretty frequent use, where a stranger might stand for hours waiting for a local passer-by to direct him on his way."
