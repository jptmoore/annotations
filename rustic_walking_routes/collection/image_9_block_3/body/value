"At an average distance of about a mile to the north of the Totteridge-Brockley ridge there rises a longer and yet higher latitudinal ridge, which begins by an ascent from New Barnet to High Barnet, and runs through Arkley to Elstree, beyond which latter it makes a drop before rising to its greatest height at Bushey Heath. There it deflects a little to the south, and, after junction with the Totteridge- Brockley ridge, runs in a less developed form on to the north-west corner of Middlesex, where it makes a final rise and fall. This ridge, from a height of 400 fect at Iligh Barnet, attains to 463 at Arkley, 478 at Elstree, and 500 at Bushey Ileath; whereas the greatest elevations of the 1lornsey-Ilampstead ridge are 427 feet at llighgate, and 438 at Hampstead Heath; and of the Totteridge-Brockley ridge, 410 feet at Totteridge, and 416 at Brockley."
