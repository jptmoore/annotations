"It may here be stated that valuable information concern- ing foot-path rights, as well as protection in the enjoyment of them, can be obtained by joining the National Foot-path Preservation Society, whose office is at 42 Essex Street, Strand (Secretary, Henry Allnutt, Esq.). Every foot-path rambler who can afford the minimum subscription of five shillings per annum should assist in supporting this society, to which his grace the Duke of Westminster considerately lends his name as Patron, and the non-political character of which is shown by its list of Vice-Presidents containing names like those of Lord Randolph Churchill and Samuel Morley, Esq. A prospectus of the society may be obtained by addressing the Secretary, as above."
