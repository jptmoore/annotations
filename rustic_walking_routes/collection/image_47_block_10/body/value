"follow the lane to its rightward bend, just beyond three cottages and a small br'dge, where, at a rude stile beside a field-gate, take a field-path straight into a road. ‘There turn to the right three hundred yards (bearing leftward at the Red Lion) to a row of cottages running off on the left. Go down in front of these to a field-path entered over a gate (where some pales are omitted in its centre), which follow till it runs into a lane. There turn a little to the right to the swing-gate of a continuing path, which take into a lan. Cross this, and go straight on over the roilway foot bridge to a path beside a carriage-drive. Fol- low this past a farm-house, and on till it ends at a narrow lane, which leads rightw rd across a road into Pinner. ReTUuRN.—By Met. R.: 3 cl. to King’s Cross, 103d."
