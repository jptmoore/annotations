"Route.—Leaving Harrow station on the up side, turn : leftward as for Harrow Weald. In a quarter of a mile, just as you are getting clear of the houses, look out upon your right for a field-gate, with the inscription * Sayer, Corn Merchant’’ above it. Paus through this gate to a field-road slanting off to the left, and follow this track in the first field. Then take the foot-path diverging to the right, till it runs out beside a cottage into a lane. There turn to the right, and at the cross-roads keep straight on past a row of cottages on the left, beyond which the lane ends at a field-gate and the stile of a foot-path. Take this path, from which a leftward divergence leads up Belmont (well worth ascending for the prospect) ; but your direet way lies straight across the fields until you come to the angle of a green lane. There keep straight through, till, where the lane turns off to the right, you find the stile of a continuing path, which will bring you out on a road at Stanmore Marsh, with the Green Man tavern to the right. Still go straight on, crossing the green to a plank bridge over the brook, and then bear leftward into a road. Fol- low this road a full mile into Edgware."
