"It appears to be rather generally assumed that all North Middlesex and the intersecting portions of Hertfordshire are being rapidly invaded by the *speculative builder,‚Äù and that everywhere the number of houses and people is on the increase. Indeed, this impression might very naturally be made upon any person only accustomed to ride out from London by the great railways, or to drive by the highways. The Uxbridge Road, the ITarrow Road, the Edgware Road, and the High Barnet Road, each with a railway running nearly alongside, are really becoming mere prolongations of London streets, and exhibit every appearance of growing populousness. But in between the trunk highways and railways there are still left many square miles of territory now nearly as rural as it was centuries ago. Between the Uxbridge Road and the Iarrow Road, out Greenford and Northolt way, and right on to Pinner, dwellings and people are sparse and rustic, and quite in keeping with the rural scenery around them; between the Harrow Road and the Edgware Road, up through Kingsbury or through Preston and Kenton to Stanmore, the same conditions prevail ; and 80 between the Edgware Road and the Iligh Barnet Road, especially to the north of IIendon and the north-west of Finchley, as the explorer approaches the hills and dales of Mill IIill and Totteridge."
