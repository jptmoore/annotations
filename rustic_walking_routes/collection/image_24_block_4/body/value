"(1) For the most direct route (and by no means an unpleasant one), turn leftward into the road to Hendon, which follow straight on for nearly two miles, till, a quarter of a mile beyond the Brent Bridge, the road branches to right and left of a railed-in green space. Follow the leftward branch three or four hundred yards to the swing-gate of a foot-path on the right. Take this path (avoiding two leftward divergences) till it runs out opposite the Midland Arms tavern in Hendon."
