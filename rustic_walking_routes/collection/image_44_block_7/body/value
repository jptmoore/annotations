"and over the railings to a continuing path, leading to the further right-hand corner of the field, and bringing you in a full half-mile out upon a road at Mill Hill. There turn leftward a little way to the Adam and Eve tavern. With your back towards the inn, take an opposite road, with a shrub-planted enclosure to the left of it, and, bearing to the right, go a quarter of a mile down a shady lane, to a farm-road gate with a stile on its left side. Go straight down the field-road till you come opposite to three cot- tages. Crossing a stream (into Hertfordshire), take the field-path to the right, alongside the stream, till you come into a lane, which will bring you up to Totteridge church. Sce Route 14 for further directions."
