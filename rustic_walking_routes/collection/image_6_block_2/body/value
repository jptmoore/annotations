"Experience has taught the writer that the most pleasant and profitable way for unencumbered men to take a rural outing is to ride out to some country town or village, and thence to start across country for some place on a different railway system. He has accordingly arranged his walking routes in journeys of six to ten miles, which he himself has found it feasible and pleasurable to accomplish without undue exertion. Novices in recreative pedestrianism may, however, not only begin by exercising themselves upon the shorter routes, but may divide some of the longer ones into trips of a few miles. Persons, too, who may wish to use field-paths for out-and-in rambles in connection with any particular town or village, or for round-about investi- gating strolls rather than for long cross-country walks, will find in this work, with its map, a trustworthy guide."
