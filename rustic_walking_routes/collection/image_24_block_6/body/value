"As you face this tavern, you will observe Church Lane about thirty or forty yards to the left. Take this lane, and follow its leftward bend past the church and down a declivity, till at the bottom you reach an obvious rightward bend, with a field-gate in front of you. From this gate take a field-path, which passes under a railway arch, and then runs through meadow after meadow for fully two miles (skirting the Silk Stream at times), until at length it emerges into a traffic road. Cross this, bearing a little leftward, to a swing-gate admitting to two continuing paths, the leftward of which leads into the middle - of Edgware village, and the rightward direct to the railway station, in Church Lane, with the Railway Tavern alongside, and the old parish church nearly opposite."
