"a transverse one. Cross the latter to a swing-gate admit- 8 ting to a field-path, and take this till it crosses the Brent, and runs through Perivale churchyard (the small church being open, and worth examination) into the miniature village. There continue a straight course up an opposite lane for about three-quarters of a mile, till, a little beyond the canal, you come to Horsenden Hill on the right (well worth ascending for the prospect) and the Ballot-box inn a little further on. Still go on straight for three-eighths of a mile, till the road bends sharply to the left. There, in the corner, take the leftward of two field-paths entered by a stile beside a field-gate, and follow it to a continuing green lane, leading into a traffic road. Turn there to the right a few hundred yards to the Rising Sun tavern."
