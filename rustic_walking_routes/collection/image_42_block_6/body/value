"At the further side of the Chequers turn to the right, till almost immediately you find, among the tall palings on your left, a double-X step-ladder stile, admitting to a field-path. Follow this path for three-quarters of a mile across fields, bearing to the right on approaching a farm- house. On emerging into the road, turn rightward to a finger-post within view, where take the left-hand road indicated as leading to Wembley, and proceed for half a mile (avoiding any leftward turn) to cross-roads. There take the right-hand road, indicated as that to Kingsbury, aud follow its course for about a mile and a half. Where it runs into a transverse road, keep to the right, and two hundred yards further on turn to the left between two farm-houses. Go straight on for a full quarter of a mile, avoiding the leftward road to Kingsbury, and following the one marked as “ No Thoroughfare’ past Kingsbury church and through a field-gate into a green enclosure. There, in the left-hand corner, take a field-path entered by a stile, aud follow it over one field, leftward acro s a lane, and then over several other fields, until it emerges into a road. There turn to the right, and proceed three- quarters of a mile, till you reach the Upper Welsh Harp, on the Edgware Road, close to Hendon station."
