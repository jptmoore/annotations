"- left a full half-mile to the centre of the hamlet of Colney Hatch. Passing to the left of the Orange- tree tavern, bear then to the right (to Finchley). Within two or three hundred yards, just beyond a roadside pool, bear again to the right, and go on nearly three-quarters of a mile to the Barnet high- way. There turn rightward a little way to a lane on the left with a small public-house at its corner. Turn down this lane, and cross the Finchley Road to a continuing lane, which follow till it runs into a transverse road. There (with a farm-house in front of you and an alley-path to your right) turn leftward for some 250 yards, till you reach on the right the swing-gate of a field-path running parallel with a lane on the other side of the hedge. Take this path through one field, and then pass under a railway arch to the swing-gate of a continuing field-path running beside a cart-track. Follow the cart-track, and afterwards the diverging foot-path, till you emerge into a green lane. There bear a little to the left, and then turn to the right up a hard lane, which follow to its outlet into a road. Bear to the right on this road till you come to the Adam and Eve tavern, when bear leftward for a quarter of a mile, and afterwards rightward into Mill Hill as far as the Kingâ€™s Head on the right."
