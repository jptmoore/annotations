"There turn to the left a little, until, before passing the Prince Albert inn, you reach a stile on the right. Of two field-paths starting thence, take the leftward; and a little way up the ascent pass to the left of the wood if you find open the old and proper track to Decoy Farm. Otherwise go on by the Allotments path to a lane, and turn leftward to the farm. Opposite the house, at the large white gate on your right, you can take a field-path running leftward into Finchley Lane ; or, for a more picturesque way, cross the Brent, and go on two hundred yards to a lane on the right, a little way up which (where the black board fence begins) take from a stile on the right a path into Finchley Lane. There turn rightward to the bridge, where take a path to the left. On emerging from this, go straight on to Finchley church on the left. Turn into the churchyard, from the back of which take the right-hand path, and at its outlet cross to a continuing road (Nether Street). Go on a full mile to the first road on the right, opposite which a field-path leads to an alley-path for Woodside station. But for Whetstone go on to an alley-path between two roads, which follow till it runs out rightward to the highroad. Turn leftward, to the first road on the left, for Whetstone station ; or go on a quarter of a mile to a stile between a black barn and an old gable-fronted house for a field-path to picturesque Oakley Park station."
