"Hig hﬁ RouTr.—From Hampstead station go on up the heath by the right-hand carriage-road for nearly half a mile, to the second wide gravelled path on the right (beyond the boundary wall of the Pryors, und opposite a double street- turning), and take this path past the pond, the hotel, and the roundabouts. Then bear leftward over the turf, so as to cross a roadway into the upper heath; where keep on straight, and cross another roadway to the north-western boundary of the heath. There, about forty yards to the right of a farm-house, take a cart-track through several fields, and a continuing field-path to a green lane, which follow straight to its outlet at Temple Fortune, upon the Finchley Road, opposite the Royal Oak tavern."
