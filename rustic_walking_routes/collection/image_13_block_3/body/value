"On the western side of our district, beyond the limits of the Brent watershed, some small streams rise on the western slope of Harrow Weald and the southern slope towards Pinner, and just above the latter place combine into a brook. After flowing southward through that village, the brook turns westward to Eastcot, and then goes on south-westward, gathering small afluents on its way, till it falls at length into the Colne just above West Drayton. But between the course of this brook and the western side of the Brent watershed several small streams drain the southern slope below Pinner and the western slopes of Harrow and Northolt. By a junction of these in a longitudinal depression a stream is constituted that flows south- ward past Yedding as Yedding Brook, and then through Cranford as the River Cran, til at Hounslow Powder-mills it makes a junction with an eastern offshoot of the Colne. Thence the combined stream flows on south-east, east, north-east, and north, running in its latter course parallel to the Thames, until at Isleworth it turns eastward into that river."
