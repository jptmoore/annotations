"(1) You may go up the road a mile and a quarter to a transverse road at Preston, where you will find in front of you a stile admitting to a field-path. A right-hand branch of this (from the further corner of the first field) is the public footway into Kenton, but is obstructed by a threat- ening notice and a high gate where it traverses a farm- yard into the road. Disregarding the intimidation, and surmounting the obstacle, you may reach the road. Here bear a little t» the right to a lane on the opposite side of the way, up which, just beyond a cattle-shed on the left, take a ficld-path through three fields t-» a green lane."
