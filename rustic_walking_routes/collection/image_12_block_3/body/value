"The lower Brent is now mainly dependent upon the affluents re- ceived into its channel below the reservoir. The first important one of these is the stream that passes under the road near Forty Farm. This is constituted of a brook flowing southward from Preston (there called the Brent), and another eastward from Harrow. In its turn, the former brook is made up of minor streams draining the southern slopes of Harrow Weald and Stanmore, and the western slope of Kingsbury ; and the latter of small streams that rise on the eastern slope of Harrow. Taking now a more southerly course, the Brent receives the combined waters of two brooklets draining the northern slopes of Brondesbury and Willesden ; then a tributary draining the southern slope of Harrow; after which the river soon turns west- ward, away from the high land towards Hanger Hill, and continues in this course to Greenford. There, after receiving a little tributary made up of brooklets draining the southern slope of Greenford and the eastern one of Northolt, the river turns south by a longitudinal depression, receives a petty tributary flowing from the eastern slope of Southall, and passes on to the Thames at Brentford by a channel in great part identical with that of the canal."
