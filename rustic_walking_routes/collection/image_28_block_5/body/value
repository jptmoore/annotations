"Just beyond the Crown, where the road divides, the leftward route affords good road-walking after rain; but for fine weather the rightward route is recommended as more picturesque and somewhat shorter. For this, either turn at once to the right, or take a field-path out of the left-hand road at a white gate just beyond a cottage, and another path to the right at the road- angle. Either way, in less than a mile and a half from Northolt, you come to a lane on the left at the further side of a white farm-house. Turn up this lane (soon becoming green), and bear leftward into a road. There still bear to the left to a green lane on the right, which take for two miles to the Pinner road. Turn to the left, and then keep to the right iuto Pinner."
