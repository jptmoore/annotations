Thence take a fenced-in field-path for about half a mile, and a continuing lane for a like distance, bearing rightward at the Rising Sun tavern into Willesden Lane. There turn to the right for a quarter of a mile, to where the traffic road diverges. Follow the left-hand branch past Willesden Green station of the Met. R., and on to a sharp rightward bend, where, by a swing-gate in front of you, take a field-path into the Edgware Road at Cricklewood. Cross to an opposite lane, and go up it a full quarter of a mile to the first left-hand turning beyond the railway viaduct. Take this road for nearly three-quarters of a mile to Clitterhouse Farm, and a continuing lane for about 150 yards further, till at a leftward bend you see before you a field-gate admitting to a foot-path. Take this path to the end of the third field, and then one tutning off to the right, which follow over a lane, and straight on into Brent Street, Hendon."
