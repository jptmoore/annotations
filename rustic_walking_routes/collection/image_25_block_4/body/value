"(1) You may keep straight on for three-quarters of a mile by the road in front of you (to Harrow), until, a short distance beyond the Hop-bine tavern, and just before the road bends sharply to the right, you find on the left the stile of a field-path cutting off the bend. Take this path, and from its outlet go on about two hundred yards, till the road runs into a transverse one. There turn to the right for 8 quarter of & mile, and a little way beyond a black barn on the left take at a stile on that side a path across Harrow Park into the town."
