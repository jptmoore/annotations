"size throughout the United Kingdom that is more abun- dantly and ornamentally timbered over its whole extent. From almost any point of view, scores or even hundreds of trees are visible. They skirt the by-roads in all direc- tions, rise amid the old-fashioned hedge-rows, or stand in groups at the field-corners. The profusion of ornamental timber in this district is accounted for only by the fact that the numerous small estates were formerly owned by the nobility and gentry as rural retreats easily accessible from London, and have now largely fallen into the hands of mercantile magnates equally solicitous for the beauty of their residential surroundings."
