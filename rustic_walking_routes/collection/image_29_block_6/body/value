"Keeping to the left, go on past Totteridge church (the churchyard containing a very ancient yew-tree) throngh the scattered village, with its roadside sward and its fish- ponds, for fully a mile and a half, to where the roadway narrows in at the end of the village. Thence follow the road straight on another half-mile to Highwood Hill, till, just beyond a roadside pond, you reach the Rising Sun tavern upon your right. To the right of this house (as you face it), go up a narrow lane for two hundred yards, to its leftward bend towards a mansion,* when you will find in front of you the stile of a field-path. Take this path for nearly a mile, bearing leftward where it divides, until you come out upon a road. There turn to the left for half a mile, till you reach a road sloping off upon the right, which take straight about a mile to Borehamwood,"
