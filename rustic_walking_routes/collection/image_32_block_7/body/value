"(2) You may at the further side of the leftward road- turning from Long Lane take a field-path, which passes disgonally between two rows of cottages, and runs three- eighths of a mile to a road. There cross over, bearing leftward, to the iron gate of a continuing path, which follow till it runs out on the Finchley Road. There pass over, and go straight by a short cross thoroughfare to the churchyard gates. Go through to the right of the church, and take the leftward of two paths leading out from the back of the churchyard. Follow this path till it crosses Dollis Brook into a lane, where bear leftward to a trans- verse road. There turn to the right, and go on straight up the hill to the second right-hand turning, where the alternative routes converge."
