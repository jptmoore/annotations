"THE tract of country traversed by these Walking Routes i3 the west-to-north or north-western quadrant of a circle described by a twelve-mile radius from Charing Cross. It contains 108 square miles; but the map, being extended to a square containing the quadrant, includes 144 square miles. The district lies wholly on the northern side of the Thames valley. Therefore, as may be inferred, there is a general slope of the land southward to the Thames. But the slope is not by any means the regular and gradual one of a flat surface. On the other hand, it is that of an irregular series of elevations and depressions, or large ridges and furrows. The prevailing direction of such ridges and furrows along the whole valley-side is longitudinal, or from north to south; and this disposition of the land-surface is manifest towards both the eastern and the western side of our dis- trict. To some extent, however, throughout the whole of it, and more especially in what (to borrow a postal term for a new application) may be called its east-central part, the course of the longitudinal ridges and furrows is inter- rupted by more considerable transverse elevations, which may be approximately characterized as latitudinal, or from east to west."
