"(2) For a somewhat longer but rather more pic- turesque route, you can from the said cormer of Hampstead Heath start by a cart-track which runs out northward fifty yards to the right of a farm- house, and go on by a continuing field-path into a lane (grassy for some distance) leading straight to the Royal Oak tavern upon the Finchley Road. Crossing this road, you may either go down the lane or alley between two rows of cottages running off to the left of the Royal Oak, till you find at the end the stile of a field-path into Brent Street, at the outlet of which turn rightward, and beyond the Brent follow preceding instructions. Or you may take the rustic lane to the right of the Royal Oak, and go straight on till you have passed over the Brent, when bear leftward into Brent Street. There cross a little rightward to an opposite tho- roughfare (New Brent Street), and go down this to the path leading rightward to the Midland Arms."
