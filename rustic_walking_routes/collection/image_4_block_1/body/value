"THE London toiler. who in summertime delights to spend his weekly leisure hours in rural rambles, feels increasingly each succeeding year his dependence on railways for the enjoyment of this healthful recreation. Time and toil are misapplied in walking out of town through miles of bricks and mortar ; but cheap and convenient suburban train ser- vices have come to the Londoner’s relief, and offer easy access to rustic scenes. Still, for want of knowing his way about when he reaches what he fondly calls ¢ the real country,” he does not obtain from his rural trips a tithe of the benefit they might afford. He generally goes to some much-frequented rustic resort, and strolls about for a few hours in an aimless, tiring way, until he recognises that it is time to return. If he ventures to walk from one railway station to another, he often takes the dusty highway as the only route to which he can trust himself; and if he shows more enterprise, by starting on a brisk walk from one rail- way system to another, he follows all the windings of devious by-roads, affording only partial glimpses of the fields, and often embartassing by their complexities. Now and then He finds by chance a field-path, upon which he enters enthusiastically, probably to be led quite astray."
