"RouTE.â€”In the main road just beyond Finchley station turn to the left, and then bear rightward to the church- yard. Passing through, take from the back the leftward of two gravelled paths till it crosses Dollis Brook into a lane. There turn leftward to a transverse road, with a farmhouse opposite the lane-end. Go through the farmyard to a gate at the back, and there (to the right of the hedge) follow a public foot-path to its outlet into a road. Bear then to the left over the railway, till, just past the second of two farm-houses, you find on your left the stile of a field-path. Take this path till it runs out into a road. There turn to the right, and almost immediately to the left, following the road till it diverges. Bear then to the left, over one railway and under another, till, two hundred yards beyond the latter, you find on your left the black swing-gate of a field-path. Take this path (crossing a private carriage- drive) till it runs out by a short lane into a traffic road. There turn to the left, and go half a mile to Edgware."
