"On the eastern side of our district, beyond the boundary of the Brent watershed, there rises a little to the north of Hadley Wood a small: stream, which, following a longitudinal depression southward, flows through East Barnet under the name of Pymmeâ€™s Brook. To the east of New Southgate this brook effects a confluence with one flowing eastward, which is made up of small streams draining the eastern slope of Finchley and the northern one of Muswell Hill. The combined stream then flows on eastward, until, a little before reaching Edmonton, it receives a considerable afluent in Enfield Brook ; when, a8 quite a miniature river, it continues its eastward course to the Lea."
