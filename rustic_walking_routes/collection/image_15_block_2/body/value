"Of commons on a considerable scale there are not many left; but, besides ITampstead Ileath, there remain Hadley Common, Harrow Weald Common, and Stanmore Common (the two last not far apart), which all provide picturesque strolling-grounds for holiday-makers. Ialing Common has been tamed down; of Finchley Common merely a shabby remnaent is left; and of Barnet Common only the name sur- vives. Even the village greens have largely disappeared, leaving little but their names, as Kensal Green, Willesden Green, or Roe Green. But, with the picturesque by-roads, the romantic old green lanes, and the numerous field-paths open to him, in a country that has relapsed into the beauty without the inconvenience of a wild prairie condition, the rambler will hardly find much reason to complain of exces- sive enclosure and cultivation in our district. As for mines or manufactories to mar the prospect, he will find none of the former, the ncarest approach even to a stone-quarry being an occasional gravel-pit or clay-pit; and the principal manufactories he will encounter beyond Metropolitan limits arce the brick-works from which the material is drawn for the continuous enlargement of London. On the whole, but few cultivated districts could be found move rural and pic- turesque than that under consideration."
