"About five miles to the north of the ridge just described, measuring from Hampstead, there rises a second and more strictly latitudinal ridge, somewhat less extensive in length than the Hornsey-Hampstead ridge, but of greater as well as more uniform elevation. Commencing in the east by a sudden rise from Whetstone to Totteridge, this ridge runs on to Highwood Hill, and, after a drop beyond this place, rises again towards Brockley, whence it extends, to the _ north of Stanmore, till it ends by merging at Bushey Heath with a latitudinal ridge yet to be mentioned as rising fur- ther north. It should first be stated, however, that from the Totteridge-Brockley ridge there runs out southward at Highwood Hill a spur, which within a short distance turns south-eastward through Mill Hill, and then eastward, end- ing off somewhat abruptly towards Frith Manor House, to the west of North Finchley."
