"The conformation of the land-surface necessarily deter- mines the courses of the streams constituted by springs or by the surface-drainage. Although we may take it that the general aim and certainly the end of all flowing water in this district is to get down southward into the Thames, yet the streams that rise or accumulate on the slopes of the latitudinal ridges must flow first northward or southward with the local slope, and then eastward or westward to cir- cumvent the extremities of these ridges. And here two limitations may be definitely statedâ€”(1) that the Hornsey- Hampstead ridge shuts off any direct southward flow of water from the land on the north, and (2) that the Barnet- Elstree ridge precludes a northward flow from the land on the south. It is true that the break occurring in the latter ridge just to the west of Elstree allows the drainage from a confined area, bounded on the south by the Totteridge- Brockley ridge, to flow northward into the Colne. Other- wise, the northernmost and the southernmost latitudinal ridges of our district are boundaries of a distinct watershed subsidiary to the larger one of the Thames. Towards the eastern side of our district there is a longitudinal ridge of considerable elevation, along which runs the highway from Iligh Barnet to Ilighgate, and over which water cannot flow eastward or westward. Towards the western side of the district there is another longitudinal ridge, down which runs the road from Bushey Heath through Harrow Weald to Harrow, whence, after an exceptional elevation, it goes"
