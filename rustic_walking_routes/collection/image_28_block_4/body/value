"From Hanwell station, turn to the right, and shortly again to the right through the railway arches. Then bear well to the left, and at an iron swing-gate take the gravel path leading across a large field to the church. At the left-hand corner of the churchyard pass through a white swing- gate, and take the field-path down to the Brent. Crossing the stream, keep to the right for two- thirds of a mile, till you reach a path branching diagonally to the left, which follow to its outlet into a road. There turn to the right, and (avoid- ing two separate turnings on the right) bear round to the left for some three-eighths of a mile, until you reach afield-gate on your right, with the stile of a field-path beside it. Take this path (avoiding any rightward divergence) for nearly a mile and a half to Northolt church, and the Crown opposite."
