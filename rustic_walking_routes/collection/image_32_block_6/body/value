"(1) You may go on straight up Victoria Road (or Long Lane) three-quarters of a mile further, till you reach the Finchley Road, a little to the right of some posts on the other side at the entrance to an alley-path. Take this path to its outlet upon a road, where cross over, bearing a little rightward, to the gate of a continuing public path, within a private green lane to the left of a lodge. Take this path, and a continuing field-path beyond Dollis Brook (keeping to the rightward track in the third field), until you emerge into a lane. There turn to the right, but fol- low the leftward bend of the lane past a park-gate; and a little further on, avoiding the green lane on the right, go straight up the traffic lane to its outlet on a road."
