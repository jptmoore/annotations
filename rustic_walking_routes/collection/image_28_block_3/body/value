"RouTE.—From Southall station, turn to the § v right for half a mile to the centre of the village O A o on the Uxbridge Road. There turn to the right, g ’ until you reach on your left, between the George X J and Dragon and the White Hart, an alley with a post in its centre. Turn up this to its outlet (a little beyond the school-house) into a lane. There bear to the left, and a quarter of a mile further on again to the left, until, just beyond the right- hand turning, and where your lane bends sharply to the left, you find before you the stile of a field- path. Take this path to its outlet upon Mount Pleasant carriage-way. There turn to the left, towards the lodge; but, before reaching this, ob- serve on the right a stile, from which take a field- path for nearly a mile into a road. Cross this in a straight course to a branch road in front of you, and go ou about a mile to Northolt church, with the Crown tavern nearly opposite."
