"Route.—From Kilburn station turn to the left up the Edgware Road for a quarter of a mile, to the top of the acclivity, where two opposite lanes run off. Turn up the right-hand one (Mill Lane) a little way to a finger-post indicating a field-path to Child’s Hill. Take this path over several fields, across a lane (keeping to the right of a farm-house), and then over two more fields into a road. Turning here to the right past the church, you will at the rear of a chapel in the first street on the left find a stile, from which an irregular rightward track starts in your direction ; but it will be safer to pass this street, and take the new building road beyond it, which runs virtually into a legitimate field-path, with a stile visible before you, to the right of the houses. Follow this path straight on, till, in less than a mile, you pass among the filtering beds into a lane. TFollow this until it runs into a transverse lane, where bear a little to the right, and then to the left over the Brent. In a short distance, where the road turns to the right, you will find in the angle, and to the left of a cottage, a latch-gate admitting to a field-path. Take this path, and avoid any leftward divergence or turning to the right, until it runs out into Hendon opposite the Midland Arms tavern, with Church Lane a little to the left."
