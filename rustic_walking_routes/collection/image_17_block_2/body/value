"Sad as this depopulation may seem in regard to decaying villages and hamlets, it has its favourable aspect to persons who seek relief from London noisc and bustle in rural quiet and seclusion. For the enjoyment of this contrast, many parts of our district are as suitable as rustic tracts at a far greater distance ; nor is there much fear of their seclusion being materially affected if a few hundred ramblers should be scattered on our thirty-two routes every half-holiday during summer. In any case, the earnest seeker after soli- tude will only have to avoid holidays to find an ample field for the indulgence of his taste."
