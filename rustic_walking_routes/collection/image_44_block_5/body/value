"Go up Church Lane a little beyond its leftward bend, to the gateway of the churchyard on the right. Enter by the small gate at the side, and pass through the church- yard by a path leading diagonally out to the right into a narrow lane. Cross this lane to an opposite gravelled path, and follow this path across two roads to the further corner of the lawn-tennis ground. At the angle go down an alley between two walls, and through an arch, till you come out to a gravelled field-path. Follow this path for a full mile, till it crosses a railway and comes out on a road."
