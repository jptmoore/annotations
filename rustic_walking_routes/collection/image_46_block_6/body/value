"Passing the station, go on past the houses, until, just beyond a black barn and cottage combined, you reach on the right the swing-gate of a field-path. Take this path to its outlet at a road-corner, whence bear rightward to The Hale. There, at th  cross roads, bear to the left past the Green Man (as for Highwood Hill). Havingin a third of a mile passed over a railway, look out upon the right for a small, rude stile, whence take a field-path cut- ting off a bend in your road. On returning leftward to the road, go on past a villa and the small white gate of one field-path, to the similar gate of a second path. Take this path (uffording an extensive view) till it emerges into a lane. There turn to the left, and, avoiding a sharp up- hill turning to the right, follow your lane into a trans- verse traffic road, which cross to a small gate opening on two field-paths. Take the right-hand path till you come out on a green roadside corner at the western extremity of Totteridge. Cross the road, bearing a little to the right, till you find, to the left of a villa, the small latch-gate of a field-path, which take till it ends at a lane, There turn to the right, and go straight nearly two miles for Baruet"
