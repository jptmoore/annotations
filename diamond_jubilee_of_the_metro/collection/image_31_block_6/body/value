"CHALFONT & LATIMER Station serves the historic village of Chalfont St. Giles. Here in the half-timbered cottage, still preserved, Milton sought refuge from the terrors of the Great Plague, and wrote ** Paradise Regained.” At Jordans, close by, lie the remains of the immortal William Penn.  Vache House in the neighbourhood, dates from 1277, and at the ‘‘ The Stone,” Cromwell is reported to have slept."
