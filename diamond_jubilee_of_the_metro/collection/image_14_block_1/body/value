Enough to say that by 1870 the opening of the District Line from Westminster to Blackfriars left only the short gap to be completed from Blackfriars to Moorgate Street, and this was further reduced in the following year by the District’s extension to the Mansion House. The com- pletion of the last link, however, was delayed several years by acute conflict of will between the Metropolitan and the District Companies, and so it came about that before the Inner Circle was finished in 1884 the St. John’s Wood Railway had long since been taken over by the Metropolitan, and the St. John's Wood and Harrow Extension Line, as it was called, had safely reached Harrow and was joyously stretching forward to Pinner (1885) and Rickmansworth (1887). During these important years the Metropolitan had been under the guidance of Sir Edward Watkin. His first achievement was to establish the principles of sound finance as the basis of the Company's policy ; he had a still more strenuous and prolonged fight with the District for the completion of the Inner Circle on terms and conditions which he deemed just to Metropolitan interests. Secure of his Circle, he pushed further and further out into the fields and, gifted always with a superb imagination which made light of difficulties, dreamed his great dream of linking up his favourite Metropolitan with the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincoln Railway which then was casting its eyes towards the South."
