"It is of much interest to note that the Company’s Engineer, Mr. Fowler, afterwards Sir John Fowler, boldly promised the public a smokeless engine in reply to those who declared that the tunnels must soon be choked with suffocat- ing fumes. His first idea was to use atmospheric pressure, on Brunel’s system, but he abandoned this in favour of a fireless locomotive, the steam for which was to be obtained from a plain cylindrical egg-shaped boiler, which was to be charged anew at each end of the line at exceedingly high pressure. His experiments had showed that the loss of pressure from transmission was very slight, and he expected therefore to get more than sufficient power to work the trains over so short a journey with full allowance for the stops and the restarting. Even before the line was completed, however, Fowler found that the plan was not feasible and steam locomotives had to be employed after all, with the result, as older travellers by the Metropolitan will well remember, that the tunnels, especially in certain portions of the line, were apt to be very much choked with smoke and the walls soon became encrusted with grime and soot. Practically speaking, as Fowler afterwards acknowledged, little was achieved towards the mitigation of the smoke nuisance on underground rail- ways until electricity came to the rescue, and the * fireless locomotive”’ assumed a shape which no one foresaw in 1863."
