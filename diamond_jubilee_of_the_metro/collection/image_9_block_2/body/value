"January 10th, 1863, was an important day for London, for the opening of the Metropolitan Railway brought instant and sensible relief to a most appalling street congestion. Londoners have been well used to congestion for centuries, but few to-day have any conception of the almost impassable state of the streets in the middle of the 19th century. It often took longer to cross the City in a horsed vehicle—and there were no others—than to travel by rail to Brighton or to Oxford. Vast masses of heavy goods were still regularly dealt with at the old coaching office depdts in the main streets. The thoroughfares were blocked by hundreds of omnibuses. The traffic was as noisy as it was slow, and the clatter on the stone setts made London the most ear- splitting city of the werld. To get rid of any traffic from the streets, and thus enable people to move with greater freedom, was welcomed as a great boon, and it may be mentioned that the original promoters of the North Metropolitan expected that their line would carry more goods traffic than passengers. Each succeeding generation soon forgets how its predecessors lived, and these facts are recalled to account for the enthusiasm with which the opening of the new line was greeted."
