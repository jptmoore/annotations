"Other improvements were also seen to be most desirable. The enormous capital expenditure required still postponed the doubling of the track through the long tunnel from Baker Street to Finchley Road, but it was found possible to widen and double the line from Finchley Road to Wembley Park, thus enabling a much-extended express traffic to be developed without impeding the slow traffic, by avoiding several stopping stations. The construction of a new bridge over the main road at Kilburn was the chief engineering feature of this scheme, which was carried through without any interference with the ordinary services. The rebuilding and enlarging of Baker Street Station, begun in July, 1912, and carried through with only a single hour's stoppage of the normal service one Sunday morning, was a remarkable feat. The old station had long been inadequate and unworthy; the new Baker Street Station admirably fulfils its utilitarian functions within, and presents a good frontage and screen to the Marylebone Road. From the passengers’ point of view, perhaps, the most welcome feature of the improvement of the station premises was the provision—or rather the restoration—of through traffic to the City, thus obviating the necessity of an inconvenient change, and the provision of a physical connection by means of an escalator with the Bakerloo Tube. The widening of the line from Finchley Road to Wembley Park, and the reconstruction of Baker Street Station, will always be associated with the General Managership of Mr. R. H. Selbie, C.B.E."
