"THE CHALK HILL ESTATE, immediately adjoining Wembley Park Station, comprises some 123 acres, and has been planned out in plots, from }-acre upwards, for the erection of small houses and bungalows of a country type, with ample grounds for gardens and orchards. This is a very popular scheme of development, and is appealing to a large number of buyers, who are securing their plots at very reasonable prices."
