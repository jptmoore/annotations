"traced on a map of London it had the shape of a hockey- stick. But the dominant idea in the promoters’ minds revealed itself in the route selected. It was to link together the northern railway termini and bring them into touch with the City. The Great Western at Paddington, the London and Birmingham at Euston, the Midland at St. Pancras, and the Great Northern at King’s Cross discharged their passengers and their freights along the same line of road running East and West, and for twenty years and more before 1863 various projects had been mooted for establishing physical connection between them and bringing the country lines into close contact with the heart of the City. All sorts of fantastic schemes were started—a scheme for draining the Regent’s Canal and transforming it into a railway with wide extensions, a scheme for an overhead railway on arches, a scheme for a Crystal Way to be covered with glass and combined with a boulevard all round London, and a bold scheme of four double lines under new street surfaces in grand new thoroughfares to the furtherance of which Mr. Charles Pearson, the City Solicitor, devoted for many years his superabundant energy and enthusiasm. He was the real founder, though by no means the only begetter, of the Metropolitan Railway, but the plan eventually adopted was but a pale shadow of the stupendous undertaking to gain support for which he held scores of public meetings and wrote voluminously to the public press."
