"RUISLIP contains numerous relics of bygone days. Its church dates from the thirteenth century and within the tower is an ancient iron-bound chest and a curious carve! oak bread cupboard which holds the loaves regularly distributed every Sunday in compliance with the provisions of the benefaction of Jeremiah Bright, made in 1697."
