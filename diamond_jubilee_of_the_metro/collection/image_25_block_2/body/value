"The Metropolitan has borne its part through many vicissi- tudes with a great heart for sixty years. It hopes to bear it for many more, whatever changes may come in means of traction,in mode of travel,in conceptions of comfort,in methods of organization, in systems of administration, in theories of control and management. It lives up to a great name; it acts up to a noble motto ; it looks forward to a more splendid tuture."
