"The junction with the Great Northern was completed in October, 1363, when Great Northern trains started running to Farringdon Street. In 1364 the Hammersmith line opened with broad-gauge trains running from Hammersmith to Shepherd’s Bush, Notting Hill and Westbourne Park, and so on to Bishop’s Road and the City. In the following year the Metropolitan had pushed through to Moorgate Street. In 1367 the Hammersmith and City Line was vested in the Great Western and Metropolitan Companies. In 1868 new links were added, for the Western Metropolitan extension was opened from Edgware Road to South Kensington, and the District opened from South Kensington to Westminster Bridge ; a junction with the Midland was effected at King's Cross ; and the way was made smooth for the future extension of the Metropolitan into the country by the opening of the St. John’s Wood Railway from Baker Street to Swiss Cottage. Almost simultaneously with the opening of this line, the first train began to run on the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway, though the directors of neither company could have had any idea that their lines were destined to be joined together in the days to come."
