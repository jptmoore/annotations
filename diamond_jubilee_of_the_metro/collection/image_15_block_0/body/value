"EARLY TYPE OF ‘‘ METRO ENGINE. His vision wasto transform the Metropolitan into the Southern portion not merely of a new trunk line to London but of a super trunk line which should even cross London and carry the coal of the South Yorkshire coalfields, the merchandise of Lancashire and the passengers of the whole North of England straight through to Dover and by means of a Channel Tunnel to Paris and the entire Continent of Europe. In part the project was accomplished ; in part it failed ; and the scheme of crossing London and linking up with the South Eastern dropped out of sight. But again after he thought that he had carried his plans safely through Parliament there was delay, litigation and change, and the upshot of it all has been that though a new trunk line to the North has been successfully accomplished, Baker Street is not its London terminus, as Sir Edward Watkin had hoped, and the fates of the Metropolitan and the new Great Central are associated in a manner quite different from that which he had planned. Sir Edward carried his lines to Chesham (1889) and to Avyles- bury (1892), after taking over the Aylesburv and Buckingham Railway in the previous year and doubling its tracks. In the twenty-two years of Sir Edward Watkin’s regime he suc- ceeded in doubling the volume of traffic from 44,392,000 passengers in 1872 to 88,513,000 in 1894. He also opened up to the people of London a most attractive residential country, and awakened to a new and more vigorous life many little country townships of Middlesex, Herts and Bucks,"
