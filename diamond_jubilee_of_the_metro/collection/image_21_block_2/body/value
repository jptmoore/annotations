"One of the most obvious advantages of electrification was that it enabled the Metropolitan to provide a more rapid and frequent train service. But rapidity alone was not enough ; it had necessarily to be accompanied by increased security against accident, the liability to which was obviously in turn increased as the service approached more nearly to perfect continuity. Indeed, mere acceleration alone would have been of little use without the invention of automatic signalling, which the Metropolitan was the first to adopt. A very brief experiment carried out on the up road between Notting Hill Gate and Praed Street in 1907 demonstrated its entire practicability, and a general installation was immediately begun. Thanksto this automatic signalling one train can be run at the back of another with scarcely an appreciable interval between, for it is space not time which determines the interval of the trains. The march of applied science on the Metropolitan is admirably exemplified by the vivid contrast between the lonely signal- man of 1863, keeping an anxious vigil in an ill-lit recess in the tunnel at the junction at Baker Street Station, and popping his signal flags in turn through the right holes, and the ingenious piece of mechanism which does his work without possibility of slip or accident and which is never subject to mistake or fatigue. Automatic signalling has thus vastly increased the margin of safety on the railways."
