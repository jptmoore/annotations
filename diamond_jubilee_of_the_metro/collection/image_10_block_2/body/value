"The enthusiasm of that past hour can best be recaptured by a glance at the quaint illustration which is given of a private trial trip, which shows, sitting in an open goods truck, Mr. Gladstone, the Duke of Sutherland, Earl Grosvenor, and a score of other leaders of London Society—in the days when London Society was by no means easily persuaded to ride in open trucks—exploring the London of the Underground from Bishop’s Road to Farringdon Street. Well, the tunnels were brand new and very clean then, and contemporary taste was quite satisfied with the architectural features of the station at King’s Cross, while Farringdon Street was pronounced to be very handsome."
