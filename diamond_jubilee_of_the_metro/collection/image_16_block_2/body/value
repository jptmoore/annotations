"The closing years of the Nineteenth and the opening years of the Twentieth Century were a particularly anxious time for all transport companies and especially for those whose main function was to carry enormous quantities of passengers for short distances at low rates by means of a frequent service of trains. The reason for this added anxiety was that the railway world was conscious of coming revolu- tionary change. Electricity had definitely challenged the supremacy of steam ; theoretical Science was assured that the challenge could not long be staved off. Electricity was felt to be the motive power of the future, but how exactly the change was to come about and how so gigantic and expensive an experiment could most safely and prudently be embarked upon—this was the problem which deeply engaged the attention of Sir Edward Watkin’s immediate successors, as Chairmen of the Metropolitan, Mr. J. Bell (1894—1901) and Col. Mellor (1901—1904). Naturally the prospect of vast capital expenditure was not at first welcomed. The electrifi- cation of an established line like the Metropolitan involved bold decisions where a mistake meant very heavy losses, and as electric traction itself was in its infancy the experts them- selves were deeply divided as to the merits of the rival systems."
