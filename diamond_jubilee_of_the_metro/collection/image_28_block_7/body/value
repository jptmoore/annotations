"What is the particular charm of Metro-land? It is not ** violently lovely, as Byron said of one of his early loves, but, like her, it * steals upon the spirit like a May-day brealung. Its charms are many and varied. Middlesex, where it still contrives to escape the fast-spreading tide of London, wears a pleasant homely face. The elms grow tall in its fields and pastures and in the broad plain that stretches below Harrow's airy ridge towards Uxbridge."
