"WENDOVER is of considerable antiquity, tradition affirming that here Cymbeline collected his forces to oppose the Roman legionaries and traces of Roman, Danish and British Camps are to be found amongst the hills. At Whiteleaf a cross cut in the Chilterns is said to commemorate a battle fought in 910 against the Danes. At Chequers Court, one of Oliver Cromwell’s dm_lgl.ners resided—hence the numerous Cromwell relics ; whilst in an earlier building, on the site, Lady Mary Grey, sister of the unfortunate Lady Jane Grey, was held prisoner."
