"About the same time the Metropolitan acquired the Great Northern and City line from Finsbury Park to Moorgate Street, and in 1913, after the East London Railway had been electri- fied, an electric service was put into operation from Metro- politan stations to stations on the East London line. This was followed, eight years later, by the Metropolitan taking over the management of the East London Railway. An interesting feature of this system is the Thames Tunnel between Wapping and Rotherhithe, which was among the first to be constructed below the river bed. It took many years to make, for the water broke in several times and flooded the works, and it was considered one of the wonders of the age when Sir I. Brunel at length completed it, in 1843, at a cost of £470,000. Originally, it was used as a public highway and footway, but the East London Railway acquired it when their line was made, and it now plays a most important part in the chain of London’s traffic."
