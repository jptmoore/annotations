"AYLESBURY, converted by the ancient Britons into a strongly fortified seat, was held by them until its capture in 572 by Cuthwolf. During the Civil War, the Town was garrisoned by the Parliamentarians ,and at the Battle of Aylesbury, Prince Rupert suffered a temporary check at their hands, At Quarrendon are the picturesque ruins of a Chapel, attached to the Manor House of the Lees, and at Hartwell is the Mansion where lived the exiled Louis XVIII, and his querulous retinue."
