"GREAT MISSENDEN is rich in historical associations. On Castle Hill are the remains of a Norman camp and here pottery and other relics of the period have been found. Missenden Abbey stands on the site of one founded in 1133 for the Black Canons and a portion of the cloister of the older edifice still remains. Great Missenden Church dates from 1320. At Hampden House, 3 miles distant, lived John Hampden, the resolute statesman and patriot of the 17th century."
