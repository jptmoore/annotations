"(4 Arrangements can be made for Residences and Bungalows to be erected on a selected Site on any of the following Estates, for a fixed sum, to include the plot of L.and. Building and all fees, and if desired the amount agreed can be paid by a deposit of not less than Â£200, and the balance over a period of years (not exceeding 15 years) in quarterly sums, with interest at the nominal rate of 6 per cent. per annum. By this means a purchaser can have his House built to his own requirements, and secure possession on payment of a small deposit, and pay the balance as rent."
