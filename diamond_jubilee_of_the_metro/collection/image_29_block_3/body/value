"now few more charming villages than the twin Chalfonts, Latimer and Chenies, Little Missenden, Penn, windy Cholesbury, the Hampdens, Great and Little, the Kimbles, and a score of others that might be named. Few streams run a brighter course than the Chess, and where will you find woods more delightful than those of Shardeloes and Penn, Hampden, Chequers and Halton ?"
