"Are you in search of views? Then follow the line of the Chilterns where they rise steeply above the vale of Aylesbury on either side of Wendover from Tring to Risborough, and you shall have views that will linger sweet in the memory. Or try the views from Oving and Pitchcott, beyond Aylesbury, or climb to the little town of Brill, which is another Shaftesbury, so cunningly is it set towards all points of the compass. And if there are meadows where the grasses grow richer, and the may- trees throw a sweeter peifume on the air, than those of Ayles- bury towards Hartwell and towards Eythrop, I know them not."
