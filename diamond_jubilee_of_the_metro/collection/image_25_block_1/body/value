Nor has the Metropolitan failed in that service, or in a generous interpretation of its duty, and it has played a foremost part in working out a smooth solution of two of the most difficult as well as most formidable problems of everyday existence in a great capital city—the problem of cheap, rapid, continuous and safe transport, and the problem of enabling a large proportion of urban workers to make their homes in the inner and outer suburbs, and sleep in a purer atmosphere than that in which they earn their daily bread. Moreover, through one of its associated companies, the Metropolitan is both directly and indirectly contributing to the solution of the eternal problem of London’s housing, and it can also claim the credit of being the first railway company, by means of cheap fares and books of walks, to encourage the Londoner to explore for himself the more retired beauties of the fields and woods of Metro-land."
