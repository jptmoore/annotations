"The Metropolitan Railway was not brought easily to the birth. Money was difficult to raise. Trouble arose first with the Great Western and then with the Great Northern Companies. The City of London drove a hard bargain in return for its subscription of £200,000 and many of the demands for compensation were most extravagant and exorbitant. But when Pearson came on the scene again his energy drove things through, and the actual construction of the line was completed in about two years and a half, a very creditable performance considering the net-work of sewers, gas-mains and water-mains through which the tunnels had to be driven. The bursting of the Fleet Ditch Sewer in June, 1862, caused enormous damage in Farringdon Street and filled the tunnel 10 ft. deep as far as King’s Cross, but this was the only serious check to the steady progress of what was justly considered at the time a magnificent engineering feat. The tunnels were cased in rings of brick, eight thick, and so far from collapsing, they are more solid and firm after sixty years than when they were built."
