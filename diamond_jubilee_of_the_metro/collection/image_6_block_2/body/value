", Farringdon Street came to be the original terminus of the 2 Metropolitan Railway, after the original project of the City 1 Railway Terminus Company had come to nought, and the 1 North Metropolitan Railway Company entered the field with a different scheme and with the benevolent support of the Great 't Western Railway. The outstanding feature of the proposals ‘ of the new Company was that the strip of railway which IiY they had in mind should be constructed without permanent | interference with private property or public convenience by f the system of ‘“cut and cover.” The roadway was to be i dug up, the tunnel made and lined with belts of brick., and Hy the road-surface restored, and lo! there would be a railway i) safely and snugly packed underground. Other schemes had (F= involved a sunken railway open or partly open to the sky, il which would have aggravated the noise and grime of the districts traversed. The North Metropolitan Company, in the ' face of bitter opposition, carried its Bill through Parliament. It was objected by interested parties that its tunnel must ‘ collapse and fall in owing to the transverse pressure exercised by the weight of the adjoining buildings ; that the con- tinuous vibration would render the houses above quite uninhabitable ; that passengers would be asphyxiated by the noxious fumes, and that it would be impossible to run trains"
