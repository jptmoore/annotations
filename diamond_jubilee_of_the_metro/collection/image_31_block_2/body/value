"PINNER church, erected in the reign of Edward III. with its fine embattled tower from which rises a tall wooden cross, is well worthy of a visit. In the High Street are numerous half-timbered houses, prominent among them being one dated 1328. Two miles away is the ancient Manor House of Headstone, with its moat and clustered chimney stacks, associated with the name of Thomas & Beckett."
