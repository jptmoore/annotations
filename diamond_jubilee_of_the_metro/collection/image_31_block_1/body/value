"UXBRIDGE, reputed to have been founded in the time of Alfred, was in 1645 the scene of certain futile negotiations between Charles I and the Parliamentarians for the ending of the unhappy Civil War. The rooms of the old Treaty House where the conference took place are still preserved. On Lynch Green, Uxbridge, in 1550, three Protestants were burnt at the stake on account of their faith."
