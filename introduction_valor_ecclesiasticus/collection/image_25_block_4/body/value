"Vol. i. pp. 89-98, and relates to the Diocese of Canterbury, of which the Archbishop (Cran- mer) was required to make a return by the Kingâ€™s writ, dated 20th July, in the Twenty- eighth of the King. There are also Returns made of the Endowments on Officers in the Church of Wells in the time of Edward VI. and of Elizabeth, to remedy, as it seems, the imperfections of the Valor. See it in Vol. i p-129. There is also a double Return of the Abbey of Burton, Vol. iii. p. 147. But I have not met with any complaints of remissness or of oppression ; and the great complaint in after times, when the system of which this book is the basis was in full operation, was that the oblations were rated somewhat too highly: the oblations being in some measure voluntary pay- ments, and being greatly reduced in amount after the Reformation. See what Fuller says on this subject in his Church History of Bri- tain, Cent. xvi. B. v. p. 228.7"
