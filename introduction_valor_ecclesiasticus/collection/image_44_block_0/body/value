"after the Conquest so many thousands of parish churches should have been erected, as if by simultaneous effort, in every part of the land, while at the same time spacious and magnificent edifices were arising in every diocese to be the seats of the Bishops and Archbishops, or the scenes of the perpetual services of the inhabitants of the Cloister. Saxon prety had done much, perhaps more than we can collect from the pages of Domesday ; but it is rather to the Normans than to the Saxons that we are to attribute the great multitude of parish churches existing at so remote an @ra; and a truly wise and benevolent exertion of Christian piety the erection of them must be regarded."
