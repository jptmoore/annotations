"2. A very valuable Return of the particulars of the endow- ments on the Prior, Sub-Prior, and twelve other officers in the Priory of St. Swithin, Winchester, in which Church was the Seat of the Bishop of the Diocese. The value of this document arises from the Return in the Valor, Vol. IL p. 2, being without any particulars, only certain gross sums being inserted. 'There is, however, some slight variation between the sums in this document and those in the Valor. And it may be observed that in the General Index, pp. 337, 338, there is a slight oversight, the Cathedral Church of St. Swithin. of Winchester, and the Priory of St. Swithin of Winchester, being entered as distinct and separate foundations, whereas in truth they are one and the same."
